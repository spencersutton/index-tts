        Arguments.

        mode: The compression mode can be:
            generic, text (*default*. Used for UTF-8 format text input)
            or font (for WOFF 2.0).
        quality: Controls the compression-speed vs compression-
            density tradeoff. The higher the quality, the slower the compression.
            Range is 0 to 11.
        lgwin: Base 2 logarithm of the sliding window size. Range
            is 10 to 24.
        lgblock: Base 2 logarithm of the maximum input block size.
            Range is 16 to 24. If set to 0, the value will be set based on the
            quality.
        minimum_size: Only compress responses that are bigger than this value in bytes.
        gzip_fallback: If True, uses gzip encoding if br is not in the Accept-Encoding header.
        excluded_handlers: List of handlers to be excluded from being compressed.
