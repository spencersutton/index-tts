    Creates a "Sign In" button that redirects the user to sign in with Hugging Face OAuth.
    Once the user is signed in, the button will act as a logout button, and you can
    retrieve a signed-in user's profile by adding a parameter of type `gr.OAuthProfile`
    to any Gradio function. This will only work if this Gradio app is running in a
    Hugging Face Space. Permissions for the OAuth app can be configured in the Spaces
    README file, as described here: https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-oauth.
    For local development, instead of OAuth, the local Hugging Face account that is
    logged in (via `hf auth login`) will be available through the `gr.OAuthProfile`
    object.
