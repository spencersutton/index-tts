        Parameters:
            scale: relative width compared to adjacent Columns. For example, if Column A has scale=2, and Column B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B.
            min_width: minimum pixel width of Column, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in a column narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
            render: If False, this layout will not be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
            key: in a gr.render, Components with the same key across re-renders are treated as the same component, not a new component. Properties set in 'preserved_by_key' are not reset across a re-render.
            preserved_by_key: A list of parameters from this component's constructor. Inside a gr.render() function, if a component is re-rendered with the same key, these (and only these) parameters will be preserved in the UI (if they have been changed by the user or an event listener) instead of re-rendered based on the values provided during constructor.
