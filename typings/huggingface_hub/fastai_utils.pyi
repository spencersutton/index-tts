    """
    Load pretrained fastai model from the Hub or from a local directory.

    Args:
        repo_id (`str`):
            The location where the pickled fastai.Learner is. It can be either of the two:
                - Hosted on the Hugging Face Hub. E.g.: 'espejelomar/fatai-pet-breeds-classification' or 'distilgpt2'.
                  You can add a `revision` by appending `@` at the end of `repo_id`. E.g.: `dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased@main`.
                  Revision is the specific model version to use. Since we use a git-based system for storing models and other
                  artifacts on the Hugging Face Hub, it can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id.
                - Hosted locally. `repo_id` would be a directory containing the pickle and a pyproject.toml
                  indicating the fastai and fastcore versions used to build the `fastai.Learner`. E.g.: `./my_model_directory/`.
        revision (`str`, *optional*):
            Revision at which the repo's files are downloaded. See documentation of `snapshot_download`.

    Returns:
        The `fastai.Learner` model in the `repo_id` repo.

    Upload learner checkpoint files to the Hub.

    Use `allow_patterns` and `ignore_patterns` to precisely filter which files should be pushed to the hub. Use
    `delete_patterns` to delete existing remote files in the same commit. See [`upload_folder`] reference for more
    details.

    Args:
        learner (`Learner`):
            The `fastai.Learner' you'd like to push to the Hub.
        repo_id (`str`):
            The repository id for your model in Hub in the format of "namespace/repo_name". The namespace can be your individual account or an organization to which you have write access (for example, 'stanfordnlp/stanza-de').
        commit_message (`str`, *optional*):
            Message to commit while pushing. Will default to :obj:`"add model"`.
        private (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not the repository created should be private.
            If `None` (default), will default to been public except if the organization's default is private.
        token (`str`, *optional*):
            The Hugging Face account token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If :obj:`None`, the token will be asked by a prompt.
        config (`dict`, *optional*):
            Configuration object to be saved alongside the model weights.
        branch (`str`, *optional*):
            The git branch on which to push the model. This defaults to
            the default branch as specified in your repository, which
            defaults to `"main"`.
        create_pr (`boolean`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to create a Pull Request from `branch` with that commit.
            Defaults to `False`.
        api_endpoint (`str`, *optional*):
            The API endpoint to use when pushing the model to the hub.
        allow_patterns (`List[str]` or `str`, *optional*):
            If provided, only files matching at least one pattern are pushed.
        ignore_patterns (`List[str]` or `str`, *optional*):

    Returns:
        The url of the commit of your model in the given repository.
