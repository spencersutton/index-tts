def save(tensors: dict[str, tf.Tensor], metadata: dict[str, str] | None = ...) -> bytes:
    """
    Saves a dictionary of tensors into raw bytes in safetensors format.

    Args:
        tensors (`Dict[str, tf.Tensor]`):
            The incoming tensors. Tensors need to be contiguous and dense.
        metadata (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
            Optional text only metadata you might want to save in your header.
            For instance it can be useful to specify more about the underlying
            tensors. This is purely informative and does not affect tensor loading.

    Returns:
        `bytes`: The raw bytes representing the format

    Example:

    ```python
    from safetensors.tensorflow import save
    import tensorflow as tf

    tensors = {"embedding": tf.zeros((512, 1024)), "attention": tf.zeros((256, 256))}
    byte_data = save(tensors)
