    A decorator to register a function as a decomposition to the Python
    decomposition table.  Use it like this::

        @register_decomposition(torch.ops.aten.clamp_min)

    If you are writing a new decomposition, consider contributing it
    directly to PyTorch in torch._decomp.decompositions.

    This API is experimental; we are almost certainly going to extend
    the API when we make decompositions eligible for use in transforms (e.g.,
    autograd) and not just backend tracing, where we then need to know if a
    decomposition can be used to simulate a transform.

    By default, we also will register it to the Meta key of dispatcher,
    and replace the c++ Meta implementation if there is already one.

    unsafe kwarg is for reuse of this function for registering non-function
    things

    This API is experimental; we are almost certainly going to give an alternate,
