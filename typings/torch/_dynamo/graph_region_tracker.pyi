"""
This module provides functionality for tracking and managing regions in computational graphs.
It supports graph optimization by identifying and grouping similar regions based on their
structure and behavior. The module implements algorithms for:

1. Tracking nodes and their relationships in the computational graph
2. Identifying identical or similar regions across the graph
3. Managing graph regions for optimization purposes
4. Supporting deduplication and other graph transformation passes

The core functionality revolves around the GraphRegionTracker class which maintains
mappings between nodes and their duplicates, enabling efficient graph analysis and
optimization operations.

        the flattened args and kwargs of the node in each region provided that for all regions in the group, the nodes being
        added are also identical (ie have the same key computed by track_node). This is checked by verifying that the two
        nodes have the same identical node list in node_to_duplicates.
