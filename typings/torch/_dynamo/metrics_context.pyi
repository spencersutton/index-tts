"""
Metrics collection and management system for Dynamo.

This module provides context managers for gathering and reporting metrics during
compilation and runtime.

It includes two main components:
- MetricsContext: A context manager for collecting metrics during compilation, supporting
  nested contexts and various metric types (counters, sets, key-value pairs)
- RuntimeMetricsContext: A specialized context for runtime metrics collection that doesn't
  require explicit context management

The metrics system enables comprehensive monitoring and analysis of both compilation and
execution performance.
