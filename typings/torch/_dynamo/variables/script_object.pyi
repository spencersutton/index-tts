"""
This module implements variable tracking for TorchScript objects during Dynamo tracing.

The TorchScriptObjectVariable class provides specialized handling for TorchScript
objects with strong safety guarantees by:
- Enforcing method-call-only access to prevent unsafe attribute manipulation
- Converting graph breaks into hard errors via _raise_hard_error_if_graph_break
- Proper proxy and source tracking for TorchScript method calls
- Integration with higher-order operators for method call handling

Key safety features:
- Strict validation that only method calls are allowed (no direct attribute access)
- Immediate error reporting for potentially unsafe operations
- Proper source tracking for debugging and guard installation
- Safe handling of TorchScript object method calls through torchbind

The module ensures that TorchScript objects are handled safely during tracing
by limiting operations to known-safe patterns and failing fast for unsafe usage.
