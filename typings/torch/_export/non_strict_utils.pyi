    1. Handles data-dependent errors raised by torch function calls in non-strict.

    Any data-dependent error is due to some condition on unbacked symints
    that cannot be resolved. A mechanical way of fixing the error is to use
    a torch._check() call to assert either that condition or its negation.
    The handler suggests these options as code and points to the location
    of the torch function call that raised the error as part of the error
    message shown to the user, who can then simply select and copy-paste
    a suggested fix at that location.

    NOTE: Not all data-dependent errors are raised by torch function calls.
    In particular, conditions on unbacked symints can appear outside such
    calls, and as such are not handled here.

    2. Overrides torch functions that are known to cause problems in non-strict.

    Certain Python features, such as indexing/slicing, cannot be intercepted
    in non-strict. Likewise, certain legacy ops, such as distributed collectives,
    may need to be mapped to other ops. When there is special handling in Dynamo
    for such things, tracing can fail in non-strict (while succeeding in strict).
    Fortunately, redirecting to other torch functions can often fix such issues.

    3. Handles line-of-code logging for each torch function call in non-strict.
