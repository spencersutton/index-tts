    Why is this pass required in the first place?

    This is an artifact of how partitioners work today. The starting point of
    partitioner is a joint graph, which is fwd and then bwd graph. In the case
    of checkpointing, we keep portions of fwd graph in their original place in
    the joint graph, while obtaining a bwd graph. As a result, the resulting bwd
    graph has copies of recomputed fwd subgraphs followed by the original bwd
    graph. If we run this naively, this leads to bad memory footprint, because
    the fwd subgraphs are live for way longer duration than necessary. This pass
    reorders the operations such that we prioritize the ops for the original bwd
    graph while only realizing those ops from the fwd graph that are necessary
    at any given point in the graph.

    Note [CUDA Graph Safe RNG Functionalization]

    CUDA Graph capture doesn't work with get_rng_state and set_rng_state because these functions operate on CPU values,
    while CUDA Graph RNG capture uses on-device CUDA tensors. To solve this, we use graphsafe_set_state with a
    CUDA Generator registered to the CUDA Graph before capture begins. graphsafe_set_state updates the generator's pointer
    to reference a different GeneratorImpl, ensuring subsequent calls are correctly forwarded to the desired generator
    (and its cuda-tensor RNG state during graph capture).

    For each RNG operation's forward/backward pair:

    - We create two generators initialized with identical values
    - Each forward and backward call advances its respective generator equally
    - This keeps generators synchronized so forward and backward operations use matching RNG values

    When forward is called multiple times before backward (causing desynchronization):

    - We save the forward RNG state
    - We update the backward Generator's state before executing backward

    Before each CUDA Graph replay, replay_prologue updates captured RNG pointers with current states, ensuring backward Generator
    changes are reflected during replay.

    This function modifies both forward and backward computation graphs by:

    Creating RNG state placeholders for both passes
    Updating the forward node to use graph-safe RNG state
    Updating the backward node to use graph-safe RNG state

    Graph-safe RNG lets torch.compile use CUDA Graphs for graphs with RNG ops.
    For graphs without HOPs, the partitioner adds placeholder nodes
    fwd_rng_state_* and bw_rng_state_* to the forward and backward graphs. At
    runtime, the AOTDispatcher retrieves these RNG states and passes them to the
    compiled graphs.

    This works well for no-HOP graphs. With HOPs, the partitioner runs
    recursively: it first partitions the HOP (producing forward/backward HOP
    subgraphs) and then stitches them back into the outer joint graph. For HOPs
    that contain RNG ops, the outer joint graph now includes HOP subgraph
    modules with extra RNG placeholders. We must thread these placeholders
    through the outer module partitioned forward and backward graphs—this
    function does exactly that. It collects the RNG placeholder nodes from the
    HOPs and creates corresponding placeholders in the outer forward and
    backward graphs.

    There is a catch: for a short period, the joint graph is in a “bad” state.
    The HOP subgraphs expect additional inputs (because of the new
    placeholders), but the outer graph call sites don't yet provide them. We
    can't fix this in the joint graph because the joint graph's input signature
    is fixed (primals, tangents). As a compromise, we keep the joint graph in
    somewhat of a bad state for some time and, once the outer forward and
    backward graphs are partitioned, insert the corresponding RNG placeholders
    and wire up the calls.
