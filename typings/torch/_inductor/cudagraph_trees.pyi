"""
CUDA graph trees are a safety abstraction over CUDAGraphs, similar to make_graph_callables,
which share the same memory pool.  Sharing a memory pool is an extremely
important optimization when chaining multiple CUDA graphs together, as it
prevents you from needing to copy intermediate tensors from one graph to the
next, and reduces overall memory usage by allowing dead memory from the first
pool to be reused in the second.

The standard graph/make_graph_callables support sharing memory pool, but
with a lot of caveats.  CUDA graph trees remove these restrictions:

* Previously, if you recorded graphs A, B, you had to replay A, B in that
  order.  With CUDA graph trees, after replaying A, you can change your
  mind and record/replay a different graph B'; we will support efficient
  execution of both A, B and A, B', using only max(mem(A, B), mem(A, B')).  In
  other words: we support arbitrary trees of CUDA graph operations, not just
  sequences (this is why this feature is called CUDA graph trees.)

* Previously, if you executed graph A, some non-CUDA graph code, and then
  graph B, after executing graph B, it was not safe to retain any references
  to intermediates produced by A.  With CUDA graph trees, we track if any
outputs of graph A are still live by the time graph B is run, and make
  sure graph B doesn't clobber there memory when reusing the CUDA graphs
  pool.  You'll get a separate recording of B depending on what tensors
  stay live or dead.

CUDA graph trees are flexible enough to be used in Dynamo across graph breaks,
which is their primary use case.

The ability to switch from replay to record is fairly nontrivial: remember that
when you replay a CUDA graph, you only replay CUDA operations; no CPU side state
is updated.  In particular, the CPU-side book-keeping for the allocator is not
reconstructed.  However, to record a new child CUDA graph, we must restore this
book-keeping.  This is what checkpoint pool state is used for.

    A tensor in the cublas workspace would continue to be in use the workspace but would also get allocated
