    Wraps a function into custom operator.

    Reasons why you may want to create a custom op include:
    - Wrapping a third-party library or custom kernel to work with PyTorch
    subsystems like Autograd.
    - Preventing torch.compile/export/FX tracing from peeking inside your function.

    This API is used as a decorator around a function (please see examples).
    The provided function must have type hints; these are needed to interface
    with PyTorch's various subsystems.

    Args:
        name (str): A name for the custom op that looks like "{namespace}::{name}",
            e.g. "mylib::my_linear". The name is used as the op's stable identifier
            in PyTorch subsystems (e.g. torch.export, FX graphs).
            To avoid name collisions, please use your project name as the namespace;
            e.g. all custom ops in pytorch/fbgemm use "fbgemm" as the namespace.
        mutates_args (Iterable[str] or "unknown"): The names of args that the function mutates.
            This MUST be accurate, otherwise, the behavior is undefined. If "unknown",
            it pessimistically assumes that all inputs to the operator are being mutated.
        device_types (None | str | Sequence[str]): The device type(s) the function
            is valid for. If no device type is provided, then the function
            is used as the default implementation for all device types.
            Examples: "cpu", "cuda".
            When registering a device-specific implementation for an operator that accepts no Tensors,
            we require the operator to have a "device: torch.device argument".
        schema (None | str): A schema string for the operator. If None
            (recommended) we'll infer a schema for the operator from its type
            annotations. We recommend letting us infer a schema unless you
            have a specific reason not to.
            Example: "(Tensor x, int y) -> (Tensor, Tensor)".

    .. note::
        We recommend not passing in a ``schema`` arg and instead letting us infer
        it from the type annotations. It is error-prone to write your own schema.
        You may wish to provide your own schema if our interpretation of
        the type annotation is not what you want.

        Register a backward formula for this custom op.

        In order for an operator to work with autograd, you need to register
        a backward formula:
        1. You must tell us how to compute gradients during the backward pass
        by providing us a "backward" function.
        2. If you need any values from the forward to compute gradients, you can
        use `setup_context` to save values for backward.

        ``backward_fn`` runs during the backward pass. It accepts ``(ctx, *grads)``:
        - ``grads`` is one or more gradients. The number of gradients matches
        the number of outputs of the operator.
        The ``ctx`` object is `the same ctx object <context_method_mixins>`_ used by
        :class:`torch.autograd.Function`. The semantics of ``backward_fn`` are the
        same as :meth:`torch.autograd.Function.backward`.

        ``setup_context(ctx, inputs, output)`` runs during the forward pass.
        Please save quantities needed for backward onto the ``ctx`` object via
        either :meth:`torch.autograd.function.FunctionCtx.save_for_backward`
        or assigning them as attributes of ``ctx``. If your custom op has
        kwarg-only arguments, we expect the signature of ``setup_context``
        to be ``setup_context(ctx, inputs, keyword_only_inputs, output)``.

        Both ``setup_context_fn`` and ``backward_fn`` must be traceable. That is,
        they may not directly access :meth:`torch.Tensor.data_ptr` and they must
        not depend on or mutate global state. If you need a non-traceable backward,
        you can make it a separate custom_op that you call inside ``backward_fn``.

        If you need different autograd behavior on different devices, then we
        recommend creating two different custom operators, one for each device
        that needs different behavior, and switching between them at runtime.

        Register a vmap implementation to support :func:`torch.vmap` for this custom op.

        This API may be used as a decorator.

        In order for an operator to work with :func:`torch.vmap`, you may need to register a
        vmap implementation in the following signature:

            ``vmap_func(info, in_dims: Tuple[Optional[int]], *args, **kwargs)``,

        where ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are the arguments and kwargs for ``op``.

        It specifies how do we compute the batched version of ``op`` given inputs with an additional
        dimension (specified by ``in_dims``).

        For each arg in ``args``, ``in_dims`` has a corresponding ``Optional[int]``. It is ``None``
        if the arg is not a Tensor or if the arg is not being vmapped over, otherwise, it is an integer
        specifying what dimension of the Tensor is being vmapped over.

        ``info`` is a collection of additional metadata that may be helpful:
        ``info.batch_size`` specifies the size of the dimension being vmapped over, while
        ``info.randomness`` is the ``randomness`` option that was passed to :func:`torch.vmap`.

        The return of the function ``func`` is a tuple of ``(output, out_dims)``. Similar to ``in_dims``,
        ``out_dims`` should be of the same structure as ``output`` and contain one ``out_dim``
        per output that specifies if the output has the vmapped dimension and what index it is in.
