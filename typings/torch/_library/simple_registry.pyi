    Registry for the "simple" torch.library APIs

    The "simple" torch.library APIs are a higher-level API on top of the
    raw PyTorch DispatchKey registration APIs that includes:
    - fake impl

    Registrations for these APIs do not go into the PyTorch dispatcher's
    table because they may not directly involve a DispatchKey. For example,
    the fake impl is a Python function that gets invoked by FakeTensor.
    Instead, we manage them here.

    SimpleLibraryRegistry is a mapping from a fully qualified operator name
    (including the overload) to SimpleOperatorEntry.
