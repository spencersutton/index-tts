        Args:
            query, key, value: map a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output.
                See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
            key_padding_mask: if provided, specified padding elements in the key will
                be ignored by the attention. When given a binary mask and a value is True,
                the corresponding value on the attention layer will be ignored.
            need_weights: output attn_output_weights.
            attn_mask: 2D or 3D mask that prevents attention to certain positions. A 2D mask will be broadcasted for all
                the batches while a 3D mask allows to specify a different mask for the entries of each batch.

        Shape:
            - Inputs:
            - query: :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
              the embedding dimension. :math:`(N, L, E)` if ``batch_first`` is ``True``.
            - key: :math:`(S, N, E)`, where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
              the embedding dimension. :math:`(N, S, E)` if ``batch_first`` is ``True``.
            - value: :math:`(S, N, E)` where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
              the embedding dimension. :math:`(N, S, E)` if ``batch_first`` is ``True``.
            - key_padding_mask: :math:`(N, S)` where N is the batch size, S is the source sequence length.
              If a BoolTensor is provided, the positions with the
              value of ``True`` will be ignored while the position with the value of ``False`` will be unchanged.
            - attn_mask: 2D mask :math:`(L, S)` where L is the target sequence length, S is the source sequence length.
              3D mask :math:`(N*num_heads, L, S)` where N is the batch size, L is the target sequence length,
              S is the source sequence length. attn_mask ensure that position i is allowed to attend the unmasked
              positions. If a BoolTensor is provided, positions with ``True``
              is not allowed to attend while ``False`` values will be unchanged. If a FloatTensor
              is provided, it will be added to the attention weight.
            - is_causal: If specified, applies a causal mask as attention mask. Mutually exclusive with providing attn_mask.
              Default: ``False``.
            - average_attn_weights: If true, indicates that the returned ``attn_weights`` should be averaged across
              heads. Otherwise, ``attn_weights`` are provided separately per head. Note that this flag only has an
              effect when ``need_weights=True.``. Default: True (i.e. average weights across heads)

            - Outputs:
            - attn_output: :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size,
              E is the embedding dimension. :math:`(N, L, E)` if ``batch_first`` is ``True``.
            - attn_output_weights: If ``average_attn_weights=True``, returns attention weights averaged
              across heads of shape :math:`(N, L, S)`, where N is the batch size, L is the target sequence length,
              S is the source sequence length. If ``average_attn_weights=False``, returns attention weights per
              head of shape :math:`(N, num_heads, L, S)`.
