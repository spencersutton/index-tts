class ZeroRedundancyOptimizer(Optimizer, Joinable):
    """
    Wrap an arbitrary :class:`optim.Optimizer <torch.optim.Optimizer>` and shards its states across ranks in the group.

    The sharing is done as described by `ZeRO <https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054>`_.

    The local optimizer instance in each rank is only
    responsible for updating approximately ``1 / world_size`` parameters and
    hence only needs to keep ``1 / world_size`` optimizer states. After
    parameters are updated locally, each rank will broadcast its parameters to
    all other peers to keep all model replicas in the same state.
    ``ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`` can be used in conjunction with
    :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` to reduce per-rank peak
    memory consumption.

    ``ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`` uses a sorted-greedy algorithm to pack a number
    of parameters at each rank. Each parameter belongs to a single rank and is
    not divided among ranks. The partition is arbitrary and might not match the
    the parameter registration or usage order.

    Arguments:
        params (``Iterable``): an ``Iterable`` of :class:`torch.Tensor` s
            or :class:`dict` s giving all parameters, which will be sharded
            across ranks.

    Keyword Args:
        optimizer_class (:class:`torch.nn.Optimizer`): the class of the local
            optimizer.
        process_group (``ProcessGroup``, optional): ``torch.distributed``
            ``ProcessGroup`` (default: ``dist.group.WORLD`` initialized by
            :meth:`torch.distributed.init_process_group`).
        parameters_as_bucket_view (bool, optional): if ``True``, parameters are
            packed into buckets to speed up communication, and ``param.data``
            fields point to bucket views at different offsets; if ``False``,
            each individual parameter is communicated separately, and each
            ``params.data`` stays intact (default: ``False``).
        overlap_with_ddp (bool, optional): if ``True``, :meth:`step` is
            overlapped with :class:`DistributedDataParallel` 's gradient
            synchronization; this requires (1) either a functional optimizer
            for the ``optimizer_class`` argument or one with a functional
            equivalent and (2) registering a DDP communication hook
            constructed from one of the functions in ``ddp_zero_hook.py``;
            parameters are packed into buckets matching those in
            :class:`DistributedDataParallel`, meaning that the
            ``parameters_as_bucket_view`` argument is ignored.
            If ``False``, :meth:`step` runs disjointly after the backward pass
            (per normal).
            (default: ``False``)
        **defaults: any trailing arguments, which are forwarded to the local
            optimizer.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> import torch.nn as nn
        >>> from torch.distributed.optim import ZeroRedundancyOptimizer
        >>> from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
        >>> model = nn.Sequential(*[nn.Linear(2000, 2000).to(rank) for _ in range(20)])
        >>> ddp = DDP(model, device_ids=[rank])
        >>> opt = ZeroRedundancyOptimizer(
        >>>     ddp.parameters(),
        >>>     optimizer_class=torch.optim.Adam,
        >>>     lr=0.01
        >>> )
        >>> ddp(inputs).sum().backward()
        >>> opt.step()

    .. warning::
        Currently, ``ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`` requires that all of the
        passed-in parameters are the same dense type.

    .. warning::
        If you pass ``overlap_with_ddp=True``, be wary of the following: Given
        the way that overlapping :class:`DistributedDataParallel` with
        :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` is currently implemented, the first
        two or three training iterations do not perform parameter updates in
        the optimizer step, depending on if ``static_graph=False`` or
        ``static_graph=True``, respectively. This is because it needs
        information about the gradient bucketing strategy used by
        :class:`DistributedDataParallel`, which is not finalized until the
        second forward pass if ``static_graph=False`` or until the third
        forward pass if ``static_graph=True``. To adjust for this, one option
        is to prepend dummy inputs.

    .. warning:: ZeroRedundancyOptimizer is experimental and subject to change.
