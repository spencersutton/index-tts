class Categorical(Distribution):
    r"""
    Creates a categorical distribution parameterized by either :attr:`probs` or
    :attr:`logits` (but not both).

    .. note::
        It is equivalent to the distribution that :func:`torch.multinomial`
        samples from.

    Samples are integers from :math:`\{0, \ldots, K-1\}` where `K` is ``probs.size(-1)``.

    If `probs` is 1-dimensional with length-`K`, each element is the relative probability
    of sampling the class at that index.

    If `probs` is N-dimensional, the first N-1 dimensions are treated as a batch of
    relative probability vectors.

    .. note:: The `probs` argument must be non-negative, finite and have a non-zero sum,
              and it will be normalized to sum to 1 along the last dimension. :attr:`probs`
              will return this normalized value.
              The `logits` argument will be interpreted as unnormalized log probabilities
              and can therefore be any real number. It will likewise be normalized so that
              the resulting probabilities sum to 1 along the last dimension. :attr:`logits`
              will return this normalized value.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +IGNORE_WANT("non-deterministic")
        >>> m = Categorical(torch.tensor([ 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 ]))
        >>> m.sample()  # equal probability of 0, 1, 2, 3
        tensor(3)

    Args:
        probs (Tensor): event probabilities
        logits (Tensor): event log probabilities (unnormalized)
