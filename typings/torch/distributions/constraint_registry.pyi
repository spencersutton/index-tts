"""
PyTorch provides two global :class:`ConstraintRegistry` objects that link
:class:`~torch.distributions.constraints.Constraint` objects to
:class:`~torch.distributions.transforms.Transform` objects. These objects both
input constraints and return transforms, but they have different guarantees on
bijectivity.

1. ``biject_to(constraint)`` looks up a bijective
   :class:`~torch.distributions.transforms.Transform` from ``constraints.real``
   to the given ``constraint``. The returned transform is guaranteed to have
   ``.bijective = True`` and should implement ``.log_abs_det_jacobian()``.
2. ``transform_to(constraint)`` looks up a not-necessarily bijective
   :class:`~torch.distributions.transforms.Transform` from ``constraints.real``
   to the given ``constraint``. The returned transform is not guaranteed to
   implement ``.log_abs_det_jacobian()``.

The ``transform_to()`` registry is useful for performing unconstrained
optimization on constrained parameters of probability distributions, which are
indicated by each distribution's ``.arg_constraints`` dict. These transforms often
overparameterize a space in order to avoid rotation; they are thus more
suitable for coordinate-wise optimization algorithms like Adam::

    loc = torch.zeros(100, requires_grad=True)
    unconstrained = torch.zeros(100, requires_grad=True)
    scale = transform_to(Normal.arg_constraints["scale"])(unconstrained)
    loss = -Normal(loc, scale).log_prob(data).sum()

The ``biject_to()`` registry is useful for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, where
samples from a probability distribution with constrained ``.support`` are
propagated in an unconstrained space, and algorithms are typically rotation
invariant.::

    dist = Exponential(rate)
    unconstrained = torch.zeros(100, requires_grad=True)
    sample = biject_to(dist.support)(unconstrained)
    potential_energy = -dist.log_prob(sample).sum()

.. note::

    An example where ``transform_to`` and ``biject_to`` differ is
    ``constraints.simplex``: ``transform_to(constraints.simplex)`` returns a
    :class:`~torch.distributions.transforms.SoftmaxTransform` that simply
    exponentiates and normalizes its inputs; this is a cheap and mostly
    coordinate-wise operation appropriate for algorithms like SVI. In
    contrast, ``biject_to(constraints.simplex)`` returns a
    :class:`~torch.distributions.transforms.StickBreakingTransform` that
    bijects its input down to a one-fewer-dimensional space; this a more
    expensive less numerically stable transform but is needed for algorithms
    like HMC.

The ``biject_to`` and ``transform_to`` objects can be extended by user-defined
constraints and transforms using their ``.register()`` method either as a
function on singleton constraints::

    transform_to.register(my_constraint, my_transform)

or as a decorator on parameterized constraints::

    @transform_to.register(MyConstraintClass)
    def my_factory(constraint):
        assert isinstance(constraint, MyConstraintClass)
        return MyTransform(constraint.param1, constraint.param2)

You can create your own registry by creating a new :class:`ConstraintRegistry`
object.
