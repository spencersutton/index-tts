    Converts Python scalar operations into Tensor operations within the graph. This pass looks for
    Tensor operations that involve SymFloat arguments and transforms them into equivalent operations
    that use only Tensor inputs.

    Args:
        gm: The FX graph module representing the computation graph.
        shape_env: The shape environment responsible for symbolic shape tracking and propagation
        during graph transformations.

    Returns:
        None
