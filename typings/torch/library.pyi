    A class to create libraries that can be used to register new operators or
    override operators in existing libraries from Python.
    A user can optionally pass in a dispatch keyname if they only want to register
    kernels corresponding to only one specific dispatch key.

    To create a library to override operators in an existing library (with name ns), set the kind to "IMPL".
    To create a new library (with name ns) to register new operators, set the kind to "DEF".
    To create a fragment of a possibly existing library to register operators (and bypass
    the limitation that there is only one library for a given namespace), set the kind to
    "FRAGMENT".

    Defines a new operator.

    In PyTorch, defining an op (short for "operator") is a two step-process:
    - we need to define the op (by providing an operator name and schema)
    - we need to implement behavior for how the operator interacts with
    various PyTorch subsystems, like CPU/CUDA Tensors, Autograd, etc.

    This entrypoint defines the custom operator (the first step)
    you must then perform the second step by calling various
    ``impl_*`` APIs, like :func:`torch.library.impl` or
    :func:`torch.library.register_fake`.

    Args:
        qualname (str): The qualified name for the operator. Should be
            a string that looks like "namespace::name", e.g. "aten::sin".
            Operators in PyTorch need a namespace to
            avoid name collisions; a given operator may only be created once.
            If you are writing a Python library, we recommend the namespace to
            be the name of your top-level module.
        schema (str): The schema of the operator. E.g. "(Tensor x) -> Tensor"
            for an op that accepts one Tensor and returns one Tensor. It does
            not contain the operator name (that is passed in ``qualname``).
        lib (Optional[Library]): If provided, the lifetime of this operator
            will be tied to the lifetime of the Library object.
        tags (Tag | Sequence[Tag]): one or more torch.Tag to apply to this
            operator. Tagging an operator changes the operator's behavior
            under various PyTorch subsystems; please read the docs for the
            torch.Tag carefully before applying it.

    Register a FakeTensor implementation ("fake impl") for this operator.

    Also sometimes known as a "meta kernel", "abstract impl".

    An "FakeTensor implementation" specifies the behavior of this operator on
    Tensors that carry no data ("FakeTensor"). Given some input Tensors with
    certain properties (sizes/strides/storage_offset/device), it specifies
    what the properties of the output Tensors are.

    The FakeTensor implementation has the same signature as the operator.
    It is run for both FakeTensors and meta tensors. To write a FakeTensor
    implementation, assume that all Tensor inputs to the operator are
    regular CPU/CUDA/Meta tensors, but they do not have storage, and
    you are trying to return regular CPU/CUDA/Meta tensor(s) as output.
    The FakeTensor implementation must consist of only PyTorch operations
    (and may not directly access the storage or data of any input or
    intermediate Tensors).

) -> None:
    """
    Register a backward formula for this custom op.

    In order for an operator to work with autograd, you need to register
    a backward formula:
    1. You must tell us how to compute gradients during the backward pass
    by providing us a "backward" function.
    2. If you need any values from the forward to compute gradients, you can
    use `setup_context` to save values for backward.

    ``backward`` runs during the backward pass. It accepts ``(ctx, *grads)``:
    - ``grads`` is one or more gradients. The number of gradients matches
    the number of outputs of the operator.
    The ``ctx`` object is `the same ctx object <context_method_mixins>`_ used by
    :class:`torch.autograd.Function`. The semantics of ``backward_fn`` are the
    same as :meth:`torch.autograd.Function.backward`.

    ``setup_context(ctx, inputs, output)`` runs during the forward pass.
    Please save quantities needed for backward onto the ``ctx`` object via
    either :meth:`torch.autograd.function.FunctionCtx.save_for_backward`
    or assigning them as attributes of ``ctx``. If your custom op has
    kwarg-only arguments, we expect the signature of ``setup_context``
    to be ``setup_context(ctx, inputs, keyword_only_inputs, output)``.

    Both ``setup_context_fn`` and ``backward_fn`` must be traceable. That is,
    they may not directly access :meth:`torch.Tensor.data_ptr` and they must
    not depend on or mutate global state. If you need a non-traceable backward,
    you can make it a separate custom_op that you call inside ``backward_fn``.

    If you need different autograd behavior on different devices, then we
    recommend creating two different custom operators, one for each device
    that needs different behavior, and switching between them at runtime.

    This allows for open registration to specify the behavior between the operator

    The ``torch_dispatch_class`` is either a Tensor subclass with ``__torch_dispatch__`` or a

    If it is a Tensor subclass, we expect ``func`` to have the following signature:

    Register a vmap implementation to support :func:`torch.vmap` for this custom op.

    This API may be used as a decorator (see examples).

    In order for an operator to work with :func:`torch.vmap`, you may need to register a
    vmap implementation in the following signature:

        ``vmap_func(info, in_dims: Tuple[Optional[int]], *args, **kwargs)``,

    where ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are the arguments and kwargs for ``op``.
    We do not support kwarg-only Tensor args.

    It specifies how do we compute the batched version of ``op`` given inputs with an additional
    dimension (specified by ``in_dims``).

    For each arg in ``args``, ``in_dims`` has a corresponding ``Optional[int]``. It is ``None``
    if the arg is not a Tensor or if the arg is not being vmapped over, otherwise, it is an integer
    specifying what dimension of the Tensor is being vmapped over.

    ``info`` is a collection of additional metadata that may be helpful:
    ``info.batch_size`` specifies the size of the dimension being vmapped over, while
    ``info.randomness`` is the ``randomness`` option that was passed to :func:`torch.vmap`.

    The return of the function ``func`` is a tuple of ``(output, out_dims)``. Similar to ``in_dims``,
    ``out_dims`` should be of the same structure as ``output`` and contain one ``out_dim``
    per output that specifies if the output has the vmapped dimension and what index it is in.

    Given an operator and some sample arguments, tests if the operator is
    registered correctly.

    That is, when you use the torch.library/TORCH_LIBRARY APIs to create a
    custom op, you specified metadata (e.g. mutability info) about the custom op
    and these APIs require that the functions you pass them satisfy certain
    properties (e.g. no data pointer access in the fake/meta/abstract kernel)
    ``opcheck`` tests these metadata and properties.

    Concretely, we test the following:

    - test_schema: If the schema matches the implementation of
      the operator. For example: if the schema specifies a Tensor is mutated,
      then we check the implementation mutates the Tensor. If the schema
      specifies that we return a new Tensor, then we check that the
      implementation returns a new Tensor (instead of an existing one or
      a view of an existing one).
    - test_autograd_registration: If the operator supports training
      (autograd): we check that its autograd formula is registered via
      torch.library.register_autograd or a manual registration to one
      or more DispatchKey::Autograd keys. Any other DispatchKey-based
      registrations may lead to undefined behavior.
    - test_faketensor: If the operator has a FakeTensor kernel
      (and if it is correct). The FakeTensor kernel is necessary (
      but not sufficient) for the operator to work with PyTorch compilation
      APIs (torch.compile/export/FX). We check that a FakeTensor kernel
      (also sometimes known as a meta kernel) was registered for the
      operator and that it is correct. This test takes the result of
      running the operator on real tensors and the result of running
      the operator on FakeTensors and checks that they have the same
      Tensor metadata (sizes/strides/dtype/device/etc).
    - test_aot_dispatch_dynamic: If the operator has correct behavior
      with PyTorch compilation APIs (torch.compile/export/FX).
      This checks that the outputs (and gradients, if applicable) are the
      same under eager-mode PyTorch and torch.compile.
      This test is a superset of ``test_faketensor`` and is an e2e test;
      other things it tests are that the operator supports
      functionalization and that the backward pass (if it exists) also
      supports FakeTensor and functionalization.

    For best results, please call ``opcheck`` multiple times with a
    representative set of inputs. If your operator supports
    autograd, please use ``opcheck`` with inputs with ``requires_grad = True``;
    if your operator supports multiple devices (e.g. CPU and CUDA), please
    use ``opcheck`` with inputs on all supported devices.

    Args:
        op: The operator. Must either be a function decorated with
            :func:`torch.library.custom_op` or an OpOverload/OpOverloadPacket
            found in torch.ops.* (e.g. torch.ops.aten.sin, torch.ops.mylib.foo)
        args: The args to the operator
        kwargs: The kwargs to the operator
        test_utils: Tests that we should run. Default: all of them.
            Example: ("test_schema", "test_faketensor")
        raise_exception: If we should raise an exception on the first
            error. If False, we will return a dict with information
            on if each test passed or not.
        rtol (Optional[float]): Relative tolerance for floating point comparisons.
            If specified ``atol`` must also be specified.
            If omitted, default values based on the ``dtype`` are selected
            (see the table in :func:`torch.testing.assert_close`).
        atol (Optional[float]): Absolute tolerance for floating point comparisons.
            If specified ``rtol`` must also be specified.
            If omitted, default values based on the ``dtype`` are selected
            (see the table in :func:`torch.testing.assert_close`).

    .. warning::

        opcheck and :func:`torch.autograd.gradcheck` test different things;
        opcheck tests if your usage of torch.library APIs is correct while
        :func:`torch.autograd.gradcheck` tests if your autograd formula is
        mathematically correct. Use both to test custom ops that support
        gradient computation.

    Example:

        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_CUDA)
        >>> @torch.library.custom_op("mylib::numpy_mul", mutates_args=())
        >>> def numpy_mul(x: Tensor, y: float) -> Tensor:
        >>>     x_np = x.numpy(force=True)
        >>>     z_np = x_np * y
        >>>     return torch.from_numpy(z_np).to(x.device)
        >>>
        >>> @numpy_mul.register_fake
        >>> def _(x, y):
        >>>     return torch.empty_like(x)
        >>>
        >>> def setup_context(ctx, inputs, output):
        >>>     y, = inputs
        >>>     ctx.y = y
        >>>
        >>> def backward(ctx, grad):
        >>>     return grad * ctx.y, None
        >>>
        >>> numpy_mul.register_autograd(backward, setup_context=setup_context)
        >>>
        >>> sample_inputs = [
        >>>     (torch.randn(3), 3.14),
        >>>     (torch.randn(2, 3, device='cuda'), 2.718),
        >>>     (torch.randn(1, 10, requires_grad=True), 1.234),
        >>>     (torch.randn(64, 64, device='cuda', requires_grad=True), 90.18),
        >>> ]
        >>>
        >>> for args in sample_inputs:
        >>>     torch.library.opcheck(numpy_mul, args)
