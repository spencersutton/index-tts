    Options for controlling the behavior of FlexAttention kernels.

    These options are passed to the underlying Triton kernels to control performance
    and numerical behavior. Most users will not need to specify these options as the
    default autotuning provides good performance.

    The options can be prefixed with ``fwd_`` or ``bwd_`` to apply only to forward or
    backward pass respectively. For example: ``fwd_BLOCK_M`` and ``bwd_BLOCK_M1``.

    Note:
      We currently do not provide any backward compatibility guarantees for these options.
      That being said most of these have remained pretty stable since their introduction. But
      We do not consider this part of the public API just yet. We think that some documentation
      Is better than secret hidden flags, but we may change these options in the future.

    BlockMask is our format for representing a block-sparse attention mask.
    It is somewhat of a cross in-between BCSR and a non-sparse format.

    **Basics**

    A block-sparse mask means that instead of representing the sparsity of
    individual elements in the mask, a KV_BLOCK_SIZE x Q_BLOCK_SIZE block is
    considered sparse only if every element within that block is sparse.
    This aligns well with hardware, which generally expects to perform
    contiguous loads and computation.

    This format is primarily optimized for 1. simplicity, and 2. kernel
    efficiency. Notably, it is *not* optimized for size, as this mask is always
    reduced by a factor of KV_BLOCK_SIZE * Q_BLOCK_SIZE. If the size is a
    concern, the tensors can be reduced in size by increasing the block size.

    The essentials of our format are:

    num_blocks_in_row: Tensor[ROWS]:
    Describes the number of blocks present in each row.

    col_indices: Tensor[ROWS, MAX_BLOCKS_IN_COL]:
    `col_indices[i]` is the sequence of block positions for row i. The values of
    this row after `col_indices[i][num_blocks_in_row[i]]` are undefined.

    For example, to reconstruct the original tensor from this format:

    .. code-block:: python

        dense_mask = torch.zeros(ROWS, COLS)
        for row in range(ROWS):
            for block_idx in range(num_blocks_in_row[row]):
                dense_mask[row, col_indices[row, block_idx]] = 1

    Notably, this format makes it easier to implement a reduction along the
    *rows* of the mask.

    **Details**

    The basics of our format require only kv_num_blocks and kv_indices. But, we
    have up to 8 tensors on this object. This represents 4 pairs:

    1. (kv_num_blocks, kv_indices): Used for the forwards pass of attention, as
    we reduce along the KV dimension.

    2. [OPTIONAL] (full_kv_num_blocks, full_kv_indices): This is optional and
    purely an optimization. As it turns out, applying masking to every block
    is quite expensive! If we specifically know which blocks are "full" and
    don't require masking at all, then we can skip applying mask_mod to these
    blocks. This requires the user to split out a separate mask_mod from the
    score_mod. For causal masks, this is about a 15% speedup.

    3. [GENERATED] (q_num_blocks, q_indices): Required for the backwards pass,
    as computing dKV requires iterating along the mask along the Q dimension. These are autogenerated from 1.

    4. [GENERATED] (full_q_num_blocks, full_q_indices): Same as above, but for
    the backwards pass. These are autogenerated from 2.

    Args:
        query (Tensor): Query tensor; shape :math:`(B, Hq, L, E)`. For FP8 dtypes, should be in row-major memory layout for optimal performance.
        key (Tensor): Key tensor; shape :math:`(B, Hkv, S, E)`. For FP8 dtypes, should be in row-major memory layout for optimal performance.
        value (Tensor): Value tensor; shape :math:`(B, Hkv, S, Ev)`. For FP8 dtypes, should be in column-major memory layout for optimal performance.
        score_mod (Optional[Callable]): Function to modify attention scores. By default no score_mod is applied.
        block_mask (Optional[BlockMask]): BlockMask object that controls the blocksparsity pattern of the attention.
        scale (Optional[float]): Scaling factor applied prior to softmax. If none, the default value is set to :math:`\frac{1}{\sqrt{E}}`.
        enable_gqa (bool): If set to True, enables Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and broadcasts key/value heads to query heads.
        return_lse (bool): Whether to return the logsumexp of the attention scores. Default is False. **Deprecated**: Use ``return_aux=AuxRequest(lse=True)`` instead.
        kernel_options (Optional[FlexKernelOptions]):
            Options to control the behavior of the underlying Triton kernels.
            See :class:`FlexKernelOptions` for available options and usage examples.
        return_aux (Optional[AuxRequest]): Specifies which auxiliary outputs to compute and return.
            If None, only the attention output is returned. Use ``AuxRequest(lse=True, max_scores=True)``
            to request both auxiliary outputs.

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): Attention output; shape :math:`(B, Hq, L, Ev)`.

        When ``return_aux`` is not None:
            aux (AuxOutput): Auxiliary outputs with requested fields populated.

        When ``return_aux`` is None (deprecated paths):
            lse (Tensor): Log-sum-exp of attention scores; shape :math:`(B, Hq, L)`. Only returned if ``return_lse=True``.

    Shape legend:
        - :math:`N: \text{Batch size} ... : \text{Any number of other batch dimensions (optional)}`
        - :math:`S: \text{Source sequence length}`
        - :math:`L: \text{Target sequence length}`
        - :math:`E: \text{Embedding dimension of the query and key}`
        - :math:`Ev: \text{Embedding dimension of the value}`
