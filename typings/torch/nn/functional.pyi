        This function is often used in conjunction with :func:`grid_sample`

    Args:

        align_corners (bool, optional): if ``True``, consider ``-1`` and ``1``

            Refer to :func:`grid_sample` for a more complete description.

    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, the grid positions depend on the pixel
        size relative to the input image size, and so the locations sampled by
        :func:`grid_sample` will differ for the same input given at different
        resolutions (that is, after being upsampled or downsampled).
        The default behavior up to version 1.2.0 was ``align_corners = True``.
        Since then, the default behavior has been changed to ``align_corners = False``,
        in order to bring it in line with the default for :func:`interpolate`.
    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, 2D affine transforms on 1D data and
        3D affine transforms on 2D data (that is, when one of the spatial
        dimensions has unit size) are ill-defined, and not an intended use case.
        This is not a problem when ``align_corners = False``.
        Up to version 1.2.0, all grid points along a unit dimension were
        considered arbitrarily to be at ``-1``.
        From version 1.3.0, under ``align_corners = True`` all grid points
        along a unit dimension are considered to be at ``0``

    Compute sums, means or maxes of `bags` of embeddings.

    Calculation is done without instantiating the intermediate embeddings.
    See :class:`torch.nn.EmbeddingBag` for more details.

    Note:
        This operation may produce nondeterministic gradients when given tensors on a CUDA device. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Args:
        input (LongTensor): Tensor containing bags of indices into the embedding matrix
        weight (Tensor): The embedding matrix with number of rows equal to the maximum possible index + 1,
            and number of columns equal to the embedding size
        offsets (LongTensor, optional): Only used when :attr:`input` is 1D. :attr:`offsets` determines
                             the starting index position of each bag (sequence) in :attr:`input`.
        max_norm (float, optional): If given, each embedding vector with norm larger than :attr:`max_norm`
                                    is renormalized to have norm :attr:`max_norm`.
                                    Note: this will modify :attr:`weight` in-place.
        norm_type (float, optional): The ``p`` in the ``p``-norm to compute for the :attr:`max_norm` option.
                                     Default ``2``.
        scale_grad_by_freq (bool, optional): if given, this will scale gradients by the inverse of frequency of
                                                the words in the mini-batch. Default ``False``.
                                                Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        mode (str, optional): ``"sum"``, ``"mean"`` or ``"max"``. Specifies the way to reduce the bag.
                                 Default: ``"mean"``
        sparse (bool, optional): if ``True``, gradient w.r.t. :attr:`weight` will be a sparse tensor. See Notes under
                                 :class:`torch.nn.Embedding` for more details regarding sparse gradients.
                                 Note: this option is not supported when ``mode="max"``.
        per_sample_weights (Tensor, optional): a tensor of float / double weights, or None
            to indicate all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, :attr:`per_sample_weights`
            must have exactly the same shape as input and is treated as having the same
            :attr:`offsets`, if those are not None.

        include_last_offset (bool, optional): if ``True``, the size of offsets is equal to the number of bags + 1.
            The last element is the size of the input, or the ending index position of the last bag (sequence).

        padding_idx (int, optional): If specified, the entries at :attr:`padding_idx` do not contribute to the
                                     gradient; therefore, the embedding vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is not updated
                                     during training, i.e. it remains as a fixed "pad". Note that the embedding
                                     vector at :attr:`padding_idx` is excluded from the reduction.

    Shape:
        - :attr:`input` (LongTensor) and :attr:`offsets` (LongTensor, optional)

          - If :attr:`input` is 2D of shape `(B, N)`, it will be treated as ``B`` bags (sequences)
            each of fixed length ``N``, and this will return ``B`` values aggregated in a way
            depending on the :attr:`mode`. :attr:`offsets` is ignored and required to be ``None`` in this case.

          - If :attr:`input` is 1D of shape `(N)`, it will be treated as a concatenation of
            multiple bags (sequences). :attr:`offsets` is required to be a 1D tensor containing
            the starting index positions of each bag in :attr:`input`. Therefore, for :attr:`offsets`
            of shape `(B)`, :attr:`input` will be viewed as having ``B`` bags.
            Empty bags (i.e., having 0-length) will have returned vectors filled by zeros.

        - :attr:`weight` (Tensor): the learnable weights of the module of shape `(num_embeddings, embedding_dim)`

        - :attr:`per_sample_weights` (Tensor, optional). Has the same shape as :attr:`input`.

        - :attr:`output`: aggregated embedding values of shape `(B, embedding_dim)`

    Compute grid sample.

    Given an :attr:`input` and a flow-field :attr:`grid`, computes the
    ``output`` using :attr:`input` values and pixel locations from :attr:`grid`.

    Currently, only spatial (4-D) and volumetric (5-D) :attr:`input` are
    supported.

    In the spatial (4-D) case, for :attr:`input` with shape
    :math:`(N, C, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` and :attr:`grid` with shape
    :math:`(N, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 2)`, the output will have shape
    :math:`(N, C, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out})`.

    For each output location ``output[n, :, h, w]``, the size-2 vector
    ``grid[n, h, w]`` specifies :attr:`input` pixel locations ``x`` and ``y``,
    which are used to interpolate the output value ``output[n, :, h, w]``.
    In the case of 5D inputs, ``grid[n, d, h, w]`` specifies the
    ``x``, ``y``, ``z`` pixel locations for interpolating
    ``output[n, :, d, h, w]``. :attr:`mode` argument specifies ``nearest`` or
    ``bilinear`` interpolation method to sample the input pixels.

    :attr:`grid` specifies the sampling pixel locations normalized by the
    :attr:`input` spatial dimensions. Therefore, it should have most values in
    the range of ``[-1, 1]``. For example, values ``x = -1, y = -1`` is the
    left-top pixel of :attr:`input`, and values  ``x = 1, y = 1`` is the
    right-bottom pixel of :attr:`input`.

    If :attr:`grid` has values outside the range of ``[-1, 1]``, the corresponding
    outputs are handled as defined by :attr:`padding_mode`. Options are

        * ``padding_mode="zeros"``: use ``0`` for out-of-bound grid locations,
        * ``padding_mode="border"``: use border values for out-of-bound grid locations,
        * ``padding_mode="reflection"``: use values at locations reflected by
          the border for out-of-bound grid locations. For location far away
          from the border, it will keep being reflected until becoming in bound,
          e.g., (normalized) pixel location ``x = -3.5`` reflects by border ``-1``
          and becomes ``x' = 1.5``, then reflects by border ``1`` and becomes
          ``x'' = -0.5``.

    Note:
        This function is often used in conjunction with :func:`affine_grid`
        to build `Spatial Transformer Networks`_ .

    Note:
        When using the CUDA backend, this operation may induce nondeterministic
        behaviour in its backward pass that is not easily switched off.
        Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.

    Note:
        NaN values in :attr:`grid` would be interpreted as ``-1``.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): input of shape :math:`(N, C, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` (4-D case)
                        or :math:`(N, C, D_\text{in}, H_\text{in}, W_\text{in})` (5-D case)
        grid (Tensor): flow-field of shape :math:`(N, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 2)` (4-D case)
                       or :math:`(N, D_\text{out}, H_\text{out}, W_\text{out}, 3)` (5-D case)
        mode (str): interpolation mode to calculate output values
            ``'bilinear'`` | ``'nearest'`` | ``'bicubic'``. Default: ``'bilinear'``
            Note: ``mode='bicubic'`` supports only 4-D input.
            When ``mode='bilinear'`` and the input is 5-D, the interpolation mode
            used internally will actually be trilinear. However, when the input is 4-D,
            the interpolation mode will legitimately be bilinear.
        padding_mode (str): padding mode for outside grid values
            ``'zeros'`` | ``'border'`` | ``'reflection'``. Default: ``'zeros'``
        align_corners (bool, optional): Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the
            input  as squares rather than points.
            If set to ``True``, the extrema (``-1`` and ``1``) are considered as referring
            to the center points of the input's corner pixels. If set to ``False``, they
            are instead considered as referring to the corner points of the input's corner
            pixels, making the sampling more resolution agnostic.
            This option parallels the ``align_corners`` option in
            :func:`interpolate`, and so whichever option is used here
            should also be used there to resize the input image before grid sampling.
            Default: ``False``

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): output Tensor

    .. _`Spatial Transformer Networks`:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025

    .. warning::
        When ``align_corners = True``, the grid positions depend on the pixel
        size relative to the input image size, and so the locations sampled by
        :func:`grid_sample` will differ for the same input given at different
        resolutions (that is, after being upsampled or downsampled).
        The default behavior up to version 1.2.0 was ``align_corners = True``.
        Since then, the default behavior has been changed to ``align_corners = False``,
        in order to bring it in line with the default for :func:`interpolate`.

    .. note::
        ``mode='bicubic'`` is implemented using the `cubic convolution algorithm`_ with :math:`\alpha=-0.75`.
        The constant :math:`\alpha` might be different from packages to packages.
        For example, `PIL`_ and `OpenCV`_ use -0.5 and -0.75 respectively.
        This algorithm may "overshoot" the range of values it's interpolating.
        For example, it may produce negative values or values greater than 255 when interpolating input in [0, 255].
        Clamp the results with :func:`torch.clamp` to ensure they are within the valid range.

    Down/up samples the input.

    Tensor interpolated to either the given :attr:`size` or the given
    :attr:`scale_factor`

    The algorithm used for interpolation is determined by :attr:`mode`.

    Currently temporal, spatial and volumetric sampling are supported, i.e.
    expected inputs are 3-D, 4-D or 5-D in shape.

    The input dimensions are interpreted in the form:
    `mini-batch x channels x [optional depth] x [optional height] x width`.

    The modes available for resizing are: `nearest`, `linear` (3D-only),
    `bilinear`, `bicubic` (4D-only), `trilinear` (5D-only), `area`, `nearest-exact`

    Args:
        input (Tensor): the input tensor
        size (int or Tuple[int] or Tuple[int, int] or Tuple[int, int, int]):
            output spatial size.
        scale_factor (float or Tuple[float]): multiplier for spatial size. If `scale_factor` is a tuple,
            its length has to match the number of spatial dimensions; `input.dim() - 2`.
        mode (str): algorithm used for upsampling:
            ``'nearest'`` | ``'linear'`` | ``'bilinear'`` | ``'bicubic'`` |
            ``'trilinear'`` | ``'area'`` | ``'nearest-exact'``. Default: ``'nearest'``
        align_corners (bool, optional): Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the
            input and output as squares rather than points.
            If set to ``True``, the input and output tensors are aligned by the
            center points of their corner pixels, preserving the values at the corner pixels.
            If set to ``False``, the input and output tensors are aligned by the corner
            points of their corner pixels, and the interpolation uses edge value padding
            for out-of-boundary values, making this operation *independent* of input size
            when :attr:`scale_factor` is kept the same. This only has an effect when :attr:`mode`
            is ``'linear'``, ``'bilinear'``, ``'bicubic'`` or ``'trilinear'``.
            Default: ``False``
        recompute_scale_factor (bool, optional): recompute the scale_factor for use in the
            interpolation calculation. If `recompute_scale_factor` is ``True``, then
            `scale_factor` must be passed in and `scale_factor` is used to compute the
            output `size`. The computed output `size` will be used to infer new scales for
            the interpolation. Note that when `scale_factor` is floating-point, it may differ
            from the recomputed `scale_factor` due to rounding and precision issues.
            If `recompute_scale_factor` is ``False``, then `size` or `scale_factor` will
            be used directly for interpolation. Default: ``None``.
        antialias (bool, optional): flag to apply anti-aliasing. Default: ``False``. Using anti-alias
            option together with ``align_corners=False``, interpolation result would match Pillow
            result for downsampling operation. Supported modes: ``'bilinear'``, ``'bicubic'``.

    .. note::
        With ``mode='bicubic'``, it's possible to cause overshoot. For some dtypes, it can produce
        negative values or values greater than 255 for images. Explicitly call ``result.clamp(min=0,max=255)``
        if you want to reduce the overshoot when displaying the image.
        For ``uint8`` inputs, it already performs saturating cast operation. So, no manual `clamp` operation is needed.

    .. note::
        Mode ``mode='nearest-exact'`` matches Scikit-Image and PIL nearest neighbours interpolation
        algorithms and fixes known issues with ``mode='nearest'``. This mode is introduced to keep
        backward compatibility.
        Mode ``mode='nearest'`` matches buggy OpenCV's ``INTER_NEAREST`` interpolation algorithm.

    .. note::
        The gradients for the dtype ``float16`` on CUDA may be inaccurate in the upsample operation
        when using modes ``['linear', 'bilinear', 'bicubic', 'trilinear', 'area']``.

          the embedding dimension.
        - key: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)`, where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - value: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)` where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - key_padding_mask: :math:`(S)` or :math:`(N, S)` where N is the batch size, S is the source sequence length.
          If a FloatTensor is provided, it will be directly added to the value.
          If a BoolTensor is provided, the positions with the
          value of ``True`` will be ignored while the position with the value of ``False`` will be unchanged.
        - attn_mask: 2D mask :math:`(L, S)` where L is the target sequence length, S is the source sequence length.
          3D mask :math:`(N*num_heads, L, S)` where N is the batch size, L is the target sequence length,
          S is the source sequence length. attn_mask ensures that position i is allowed to attend the unmasked
          positions. If a BoolTensor is provided, positions with ``True``
          are not allowed to attend while ``False`` values will be unchanged. If a FloatTensor
          is provided, it will be added to the attention weight.
        - static_k: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.
        - static_v: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.

        Outputs:
        - attn_output: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size,
          E is the embedding dimension.

          :math:`S` is the source sequence length. If ``average_attn_weights=False``, returns attention weights per
          head of shape :math:`(num_heads, L, S)` when input is unbatched or :math:`(N, num_heads, L, S)`.

    Applies 2D fractional max pooling over an input signal composed of several input planes.

    Fractional MaxPooling is described in detail in the paper `Fractional MaxPooling`_ by Ben Graham

    The max-pooling operation is applied in :math:`kH \times kW` regions by a stochastic
    step size determined by the target output size.
    The number of output features is equal to the number of input planes.

                        dropout_p=(self.p if self.training else 0.0))

    Note:

        There are currently three supported implementations of scaled dot product attention:

            - `FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning`_
            - `Memory-Efficient Attention`_
            - A PyTorch implementation defined in C++ matching the above formulation

        The function may call optimized kernels for improved performance when using the CUDA backend.
        For all other backends, the PyTorch implementation will be used.

        All implementations are enabled by default. Scaled dot product attention attempts to automatically select the
        most optimal implementation based on the inputs. In order to provide more fine-grained control over what implementation
        is used, the following functions are provided for enabling and disabling implementations.
        The context manager is the preferred mechanism:

            - :func:`torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel`: A context manager used to enable or disable any of the implementations.
            - :func:`torch.backends.cuda.enable_flash_sdp`: Globally enables or disables FlashAttention.
            - :func:`torch.backends.cuda.enable_mem_efficient_sdp`: Globally enables or disables  Memory-Efficient Attention.
            - :func:`torch.backends.cuda.enable_math_sdp`: Globally enables or disables  the PyTorch C++ implementation.

        Each of the fused kernels has specific input limitations. If the user requires the use of a specific fused implementation,
        disable the PyTorch C++ implementation using :func:`torch.nn.attention.sdpa_kernel`.
        In the event that a fused implementation is not available, a warning will be raised with the
        reasons why the fused implementation cannot run.

        Due to the nature of fusing floating point operations, the output of this function may be different
        depending on what backend kernel is chosen.
        The c++ implementation supports torch.float64 and can be used when higher precision is required.
        For math backend, all intermediates are kept in torch.float if inputs are in torch.half or torch.bfloat16.
    For more information please see :doc:`/notes/numerical_accuracy`

        Grouped Query Attention (GQA) is an experimental feature. It currently works only for Flash_attention
        and math kernel on CUDA tensor, and does not support Nested tensor.
        Constraints for GQA:

            - number_of_heads_query % number_of_heads_key_value == 0 and,
            - number_of_heads_key == number_of_heads_value

    Note:

        In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.

    Args:
        query (Tensor): Query tensor; shape :math:`(N, ..., Hq, L, E)`.
        key (Tensor): Key tensor; shape :math:`(N, ..., H, S, E)`.
        value (Tensor): Value tensor; shape :math:`(N, ..., H, S, Ev)`.
        attn_mask (optional Tensor): Attention mask; shape must be broadcastable to the shape of attention weights,
            which is :math:`(N,..., L, S)`. Two types of masks are supported.
            A boolean mask where a value of True indicates that the element *should* take part in attention.
            A float mask of the same type as query, key, value that is added to the attention score.
        dropout_p (float): Dropout probability; if greater than 0.0, dropout is applied
        is_causal (bool): If set to true, the attention masking is a lower triangular matrix when the mask is a
            square matrix. The attention masking has the form of the upper left causal bias due to the alignment
            (see :class:`torch.nn.attention.bias.CausalBias`) when the mask is a non-square matrix.
            An error is thrown if both attn_mask and is_causal are set.
        scale (optional float, keyword-only): Scaling factor applied prior to softmax. If None, the default value is set
            to :math:`\frac{1}{\sqrt{E}}`.
        enable_gqa (bool): If set to True, Grouped Query Attention (GQA) is enabled, by default it is set to False.

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): Attention output; shape :math:`(N, ..., Hq, L, Ev)`.

        - :math:`N: \text{Batch size} ... : \text{Any number of other batch dimensions (optional)}`

def pad(input: Tensor, pad: Sequence[int], mode: str = "constant", value: float | None = None) -> Tensor:

    pad(input, pad, mode="constant", value=None) -> Tensor

    Pads tensor.

    Padding size:
        The padding size by which to pad some dimensions of :attr:`input`
        are described starting from the last dimension and moving forward.
        :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{\text{len(pad)}}{2}\right\rfloor` dimensions
        of ``input`` will be padded.
        For example, to pad only the last dimension of the input tensor, then
        :attr:`pad` has the form
        :math:`(\text{padding\_left}, \text{padding\_right})`;
        to pad the last 2 dimensions of the input tensor, then use
        :math:`(\text{padding\_left}, \text{padding\_right},`
        :math:`\text{padding\_top}, \text{padding\_bottom})`;
        to pad the last 3 dimensions, use
        :math:`(\text{padding\_left}, \text{padding\_right},`
        :math:`\text{padding\_top}, \text{padding\_bottom}`
        :math:`\text{padding\_front}, \text{padding\_back})`.

    Padding mode:
        See :class:`torch.nn.CircularPad2d`, :class:`torch.nn.ConstantPad2d`,
        :class:`torch.nn.ReflectionPad2d`, and :class:`torch.nn.ReplicationPad2d`
        for concrete examples on how each of the padding modes works. Constant
        padding is implemented for arbitrary dimensions. Circular, replicate and
        reflection padding are implemented for padding the last 3 dimensions of a
        4D or 5D input tensor, the last 2 dimensions of a 3D or 4D input tensor,
        or the last dimension of a 2D or 3D input tensor.

    Note:
        When using the CUDA backend, this operation may induce nondeterministic
        behaviour in its backward pass that is not easily switched off.
        Please see the notes on :doc:`/notes/randomness` for background.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): N-dimensional tensor
        pad (tuple): m-elements tuple, where
            :math:`\frac{m}{2} \leq` input dimensions and :math:`m` is even.
        mode: ``'constant'``, ``'reflect'``, ``'replicate'`` or ``'circular'``.
            Default: ``'constant'``
        value: fill value for ``'constant'`` padding. Default: ``0``

    Examples::

        >>> t4d = torch.empty(3, 3, 4, 2)
        >>> p1d = (1, 1) # pad last dim by 1 on each side

    See :class:`~torch.nn.AvgPool1d` for details and output shape.

    Args:
        input: input tensor of shape :math:`(\text{minibatch} , \text{in\_channels} , iW)`
        kernel_size: the size of the window. Can be a single number or a

        stride: the stride of the window. Can be a single number or a tuple
          `(sW,)`. Default: :attr:`kernel_size`
        padding: implicit zero paddings on both sides of the input. Can be a single
          number or a tuple `(padW,)`. Should be at most half of effective kernel
          size, that is :math:`((kernelSize - 1) * dilation + 1) / 2`. Default: 0
        ceil_mode: when True, will use `ceil` instead of `floor` to compute the

    conv_transpose1d(input, weight, bias=None, stride=1, padding=0, output_padding=0, groups=1, dilation=1) -> Tensor

    Applies a 1D transposed convolution operator over an input signal
    composed of several input planes, sometimes also called "deconvolution".

    This operator supports :ref:`TensorFloat32<tf32_on_ampere>`.

    See :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose1d` for details and output shape.

    Note:
        In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN, this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance. If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic (potentially at a performance cost) by setting ``torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True``. See :doc:`/notes/randomness` for more information.


    Args:
        input: input tensor of shape :math:`(\text{minibatch} , \text{in\_channels} , iW)`
        weight: filters of shape :math:`(\text{in\_channels} , \frac{\text{out\_channels}}{\text{groups}} , kW)`
        bias: optional bias of shape :math:`(\text{out\_channels})`. Default: None
        stride: the stride of the convolving kernel. Can be a single number or a
          tuple ``(sW,)``. Default: 1
        padding: ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` zero-padding will be added to both
          sides of each dimension in the input. Can be a single number or a tuple
          ``(padW,)``. Default: 0
        output_padding: additional size added to one side of each dimension in the
          output shape. Can be a single number or a tuple ``(out_padW)``. Default: 0
        groups: split input into groups, :math:`\text{in\_channels}` should be divisible by the
          number of groups. Default: 1
        dilation: the spacing between kernel elements. Can be a single number or
          a tuple ``(dW,)``. Default: 1

        stride: the stride of the convolving kernel. Can be a single number or
          a one-element tuple `(sW,)`. Default: 1
        padding: implicit paddings on both sides of the input. Can be a string {'valid', 'same'},
          single number or a one-element tuple `(padW,)`. Default: 0
          ``padding='valid'`` is the same as no padding. ``padding='same'`` pads
          the input so the output has the same shape as the input. However, this mode
          doesn't support any stride values other than 1.

          .. warning::
              For ``padding='same'``, if the ``weight`` is even-length and
              ``dilation`` is odd in any dimension, a full :func:`pad` operation
              may be needed internally. Lowering performance.
