    Return the recommended gain value for the given nonlinearity function.

    The values are as follows:

    ================= ====================================================
    nonlinearity      gain
    ================= ====================================================
    Linear / Identity :math:`1`
    Conv{1,2,3}D      :math:`1`

    ================= ====================================================

    .. warning::
        In order to implement `Self-Normalizing Neural Networks`_ ,
        you should use ``nonlinearity='linear'`` instead of ``nonlinearity='selu'``.
        This gives the initial weights a variance of ``1 / N``,
        which is necessary to induce a stable fixed point in the forward pass.
        In contrast, the default gain for ``SELU`` sacrifices the normalization
        effect for more stable gradient flow in rectangular layers.

    Args:
        nonlinearity: the non-linear function (`nn.functional` name)
        param: optional parameter for the non-linear function

    Examples:
        >>> gain = nn.init.calculate_gain(
        ...     "leaky_relu", 0.2
        ... )  # leaky_relu with negative_slope=0.2
