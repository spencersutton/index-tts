    Gather tensors from different GPUs on a specified device.

    This function is useful for gathering the results of a distributed computation.
    It takes a sequence of objects, one for each GPU, and returns a single object
    on the specified device.

    Args:
        outputs (Any): A sequence of objects (potentially tensors) to gather.
        target_device (Union[int, torch.device]): The device to gather the tensors to.
            Use 'cpu' for CPU to avoid a deprecation warning.
        dim (int, optional): The dimension along which to gather. Default: 0.

    Returns:
        Any: A gathered object (potentially tensor) on the specified device.
