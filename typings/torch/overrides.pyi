"""
Python implementation of ``__torch_function__``

While most of the torch API and handling for ``__torch_function__`` happens
at the C++ level, some of the torch API is written in Python so we need
python-level handling for ``__torch_function__`` overrides as well. The main
developer-facing functionality in this file are handle_torch_function and
has_torch_function. See torch/functional.py and test/test_overrides.py
for usage examples.

Note
----
heavily inspired by NumPy's ``__array_function__`` (see:
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/24015 and
https://www.numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html
)

If changing this file in a way that can affect ``__torch_function__`` overhead,
please report the benchmarks in ``benchmarks/overrides_benchmark``. See the
instructions in the ``README.md`` in that directory.

def get_default_nowrap_functions() -> set[Callable]:
    """
    Return public functions that do not wrap in a subclass when invoked by
    the default ``Tensor.__torch_function__`` that preserves subclasses.  Typically,
    these functions represent field accesses (i.e., retrieving a Tensor that
    is stored somewhere on the Tensor) as opposed to computation.  Users of
    these functions expect object identity to be preserved over multiple accesses
    (e.g., ``a.grad is a.grad``) which cannot be upheld if we're wrapping on
    the fly every time (furthermore, the tensor stored here might already be
    the subclass, in which case wrapping really ought not to happen).

    Not ALL property accessors have this property; for example ``Tensor.T`` actually
    just creates a new transposed tensor on the fly, and so we SHOULD interpose on
    these calls (you need to check the implementation of the function to see if
    this is the case or not).  Additionally, if a property accessor doesn't return a Tensor,
    it doesn't have to be on this list (though it is harmless if it is).

    dispatcher: Callable
        A callable that returns an iterable of Tensor-likes passed into the function.

    Note

    This decorator may reduce the performance of your code. Generally, it's enough to express
    your code as a series of functions that, themselves, support __torch_function__. If you
    find yourself in the rare situation where this is not the case, e.g. if you're wrapping a
    low-level library and you also need it to work for Tensor-likes, then this function is available.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def dispatcher(a):  # Must have the same signature as func

    A ``TorchFunctionMode`` allows you to override the meaning of all

    monkey-patch functions in the PyTorch API.  Some common situations
    where you should use a mode:

        * You want to override the meaning of factory functions, or other
          functions that do not otherwise take a tensor as an argument
          (these cannot be overridden with tensor subclasses).

        * You want to override the behavior of all functions without needing
          to wrap your inputs in tensor subclasses; e.g., if you are just
          interested in logging intermediate computations.

        * You want to control the order of execution of various tensor
          subclasses explicitly, rather than implicitly via the return of
          ``NotImplemented``.

    Independent subclasses of :class:`TorchFunctionMode` are compositional:
    modes can be pushed onto a stack using ``with MyMode():``.
    When you call functions in the PyTorch API inside your
    ``__torch_function__`` implementation, by default, they will forward on to
    the next mode on the mode stack.  If you want recursively call back into
    your current ``__torch_function__`` implementation, either explicitly
    invoke ``self.__torch_function__(...)``, or use the context manager
    ``enable_torch_function_mode(self, replace=self.inner)`` to make PyTorch
