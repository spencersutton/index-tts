    Asserts that ``actual`` and ``expected`` are close.

        \lvert \text{actual} - \text{expected} \rvert \le \texttt{atol} + \texttt{rtol} \cdot \lvert \text{expected} \rvert

    Non-finite values (``-inf`` and ``inf``) are only considered close if and only if they are equal. ``NaN``'s are
    only considered equal to each other if ``equal_nan`` is ``True``.

    In addition, they are only considered close if they have the same

    - :attr:`~torch.Tensor.device` (if ``check_device`` is ``True``),
    - ``dtype`` (if ``check_dtype`` is ``True``),
    - ``layout`` (if ``check_layout`` is ``True``), and
    - stride (if ``check_stride`` is ``True``).

    If either ``actual`` or ``expected`` is a meta tensor, only the attribute checks will be performed.

    If ``actual`` and ``expected`` are sparse (either having COO, CSR, CSC, BSR, or BSC layout), their strided members are
    checked individually. Indices, namely ``indices`` for COO, ``crow_indices`` and ``col_indices`` for CSR and BSR,
    or ``ccol_indices``  and ``row_indices`` for CSC and BSC layouts, respectively,
    are always checked for equality whereas the values are checked for closeness according to the definition above.

    :meth:`~torch.Tensor.qscheme` and the result of :meth:`~torch.Tensor.dequantize` is close according to the
    definition above.

    ``actual`` and ``expected`` can be :class:`~torch.Tensor`'s or any tensor-or-scalar-likes from which
    :class:`torch.Tensor`'s can be constructed with :func:`torch.as_tensor`. Except for Python scalars the input types
    have to be directly related. In addition, ``actual`` and ``expected`` can be :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`'s
    or :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`'s in which case they are considered close if their structure matches and all
    their elements are considered close according to the above definition.

    .. note::

        Python scalars are an exception to the type relation requirement, because their :func:`type`, i.e.
        :class:`int`, :class:`float`, and :class:`complex`, is equivalent to the ``dtype`` of a tensor-like. Thus,
        Python scalars of different types can be checked, but require ``check_dtype=False``.

        actual (Any): Actual input.
        expected (Any): Expected input.
        allow_subclasses (bool): If ``True`` (default) and except for Python scalars, inputs of directly related types

            check is disabled, tensors with different ``dtype``'s are promoted  to a common ``dtype`` (according to
