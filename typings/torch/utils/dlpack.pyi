    from_dlpack(ext_tensor) -> Tensor

    Converts a tensor from an external library into a ``torch.Tensor``.

    The returned PyTorch tensor will share the memory with the input tensor
    (which may have come from another library). Note that in-place operations
    will therefore also affect the data of the input tensor. This may lead to
    unexpected issues (e.g., other libraries may have read-only flags or
    immutable data structures), so the user should only do this if they know
    for sure that this is fine.

    Args:
        ext_tensor (object with ``__dlpack__`` attribute, or a DLPack capsule):
            The tensor or DLPack capsule to convert.

            If ``ext_tensor`` is a tensor (or ndarray) object, it must support
            the ``__dlpack__`` protocol (i.e., have a ``ext_tensor.__dlpack__``
            method). Otherwise ``ext_tensor`` may be a DLPack capsule, which is
            an opaque ``PyCapsule`` instance, typically produced by a
            ``to_dlpack`` function or method.

        device (torch.device or str or None): An optional PyTorch device
            specifying where to place the new tensor. If None (default), the
            new tensor will be on the same device as ``ext_tensor``.

        copy (bool or None): An optional boolean indicating whether or not to copy
            ``self``. If None, PyTorch will copy only if necessary.

    Examples::

        >>> import torch.utils.dlpack
        >>> t = torch.arange(4)

        # Convert a tensor directly (supported in PyTorch >= 1.10)
        >>> t2 = torch.from_dlpack(t)
        >>> t2[:2] = -1  # show that memory is shared
        >>> t2
        tensor([-1, -1,  2,  3])
        >>> t
        tensor([-1, -1,  2,  3])

        # The old-style DLPack usage, with an intermediate capsule object
        >>> capsule = torch.utils.dlpack.to_dlpack(t)
        >>> capsule
        <capsule object "dltensor" at ...>
        >>> t3 = torch.from_dlpack(capsule)
        >>> t3
        tensor([-1, -1,  2,  3])
        >>> t3[0] = -9  # now we're sharing memory between 3 tensors
        >>> t3
        tensor([-9, -1,  2,  3])
        >>> t2
        tensor([-9, -1,  2,  3])
        >>> t
        tensor([-9, -1,  2,  3])
