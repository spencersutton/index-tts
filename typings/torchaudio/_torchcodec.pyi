    .. note::

        This function supports the same API as :func:`~torchaudio.load`, and
        relies on TorchCodec's decoding capabilities under the hood. It is
        provided for convenience, but we do recommend that you port your code to
        natively use ``torchcodec``'s ``AudioDecoder`` class for better
        performance:
        https://docs.pytorch.org/torchcodec/stable/generated/torchcodec.decoders.AudioDecoder.
        In TorchAudio 2.9, :func:`~torchaudio.load` will be relying on
        :func:`~torchaudio.load_with_torchcodec`. Note that some parameters of
        :func:`~torchaudio.load`, like ``normalize``, ``buffer_size``, and
        ``backend``, are ignored by :func:`~torchaudio.load_with_torchcodec`.


    Args:
        uri (path-like object or file-like object):
            Source of audio data. The following types are accepted:

            * ``path-like``: File path or URL.
            * ``file-like``: Object with ``read(size: int) -> bytes`` method.

        frame_offset (int, optional):
            Number of samples to skip before start reading data.
        num_frames (int, optional):
            Maximum number of samples to read. ``-1`` reads all the remaining samples,
            starting from ``frame_offset``.
        normalize (bool, optional):
            TorchCodec always returns normalized float32 samples. This parameter
            is ignored and a warning is issued if set to False.
            Default: ``True``.
        channels_first (bool, optional):
            When True, the returned Tensor has dimension `[channel, time]`.
            Otherwise, the returned Tensor's dimension is `[time, channel]`.
        format (str or None, optional):
            Format hint for the decoder. May not be supported by all TorchCodec
            decoders. (Default: ``None``)
        buffer_size (int, optional):
            Not used by TorchCodec AudioDecoder. Provided for API compatibility.
        backend (str or None, optional):
            Not used by TorchCodec AudioDecoder. Provided for API compatibility.

    Returns:
        (torch.Tensor, int): Resulting Tensor and sample rate.
        Always returns float32 tensors. If ``channels_first=True``, shape is
        `[channel, time]`, otherwise `[time, channel]`.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If torchcodec is not available.
        ValueError: If unsupported parameters are used.
        RuntimeError: If TorchCodec fails to decode the audio.

    Note:
        - TorchCodec always returns normalized float32 samples, so the ``normalize``
          parameter has no effect.
        - The ``buffer_size`` and ``backend`` parameters are ignored.
        - Not all audio formats supported by torchaudio backends may be supported
          by TorchCodec.

    This function provides a TorchCodec-based alternative to torchaudio.save
    with the same API. TorchCodec's AudioEncoder provides efficient encoding
    with FFmpeg under the hood.

    Args:
        uri (path-like object):
            Path to save the audio file. The file extension determines the format.

        src (torch.Tensor):
            Audio data to save. Must be a 1D or 2D tensor with float32 values
            in the range [-1, 1]. If 2D, shape should be [channel, time] when
            channels_first=True, or [time, channel] when channels_first=False.

        sample_rate (int):
            Sample rate of the audio data.

        channels_first (bool, optional):
            Indicates whether the input tensor has channels as the first dimension.
            If True, expects [channel, time]. If False, expects [time, channel].
            Default: True.

        format (str or None, optional):
            Audio format hint. Not used by TorchCodec (format is determined by
            file extension). A warning is issued if provided.
            Default: None.

        encoding (str or None, optional):
            Audio encoding. Not fully supported by TorchCodec AudioEncoder.
            A warning is issued if provided. Default: None.

        bits_per_sample (int or None, optional):
            Bits per sample. Not directly supported by TorchCodec AudioEncoder.
            A warning is issued if provided. Default: None.

        buffer_size (int, optional):
            Not used by TorchCodec AudioEncoder. Provided for API compatibility.
            A warning is issued if not default value. Default: 4096.

        backend (str or None, optional):
            Not used by TorchCodec AudioEncoder. Provided for API compatibility.
            A warning is issued if provided. Default: None.

        compression (float, int or None, optional):
            Compression level or bit rate. Maps to bit_rate parameter in
            TorchCodec AudioEncoder. Default: None.

    Raises:
        ImportError: If torchcodec is not available.
        ValueError: If input parameters are invalid.
        RuntimeError: If TorchCodec fails to encode the audio.

    Note:
        - TorchCodec AudioEncoder expects float32 samples in [-1, 1] range.
        - Some parameters (format, encoding, bits_per_sample, buffer_size, backend)
          are not used by TorchCodec but are provided for API compatibility.
