class LibriMix(Dataset):
    r"""*LibriMix* :cite:`cosentino2020librimix` dataset.

    Args:
        root (str or Path): The path where the directory ``Libri2Mix`` or
            ``Libri3Mix`` is stored. Not the path of those directories.
        subset (str, optional): The subset to use. Options: [``"train-360"``, ``"train-100"``,
            ``"dev"``, and ``"test"``] (Default: ``"train-360"``).
        num_speakers (int, optional): The number of speakers, which determines the directories
            to traverse. The Dataset will traverse ``s1`` to ``sN`` directories to collect
            N source audios. (Default: 2)
        sample_rate (int, optional): Sample rate of audio files. The ``sample_rate`` determines
            which subdirectory the audio are fetched. If any of the audio has a different sample
            rate, raises ``ValueError``. Options: [8000, 16000] (Default: 8000)
        task (str, optional): The task of LibriMix.
            Options: [``"enh_single"``, ``"enh_both"``, ``"sep_clean"``, ``"sep_noisy"``]
            (Default: ``"sep_clean"``)
        mode (str, optional): The mode when creating the mixture. If set to ``"min"``, the lengths of mixture
            and sources are the minimum length of all sources. If set to ``"max"``, the lengths of mixture and
            sources are zero padded to the maximum length of all sources.
            Options: [``"min"``, ``"max"``]
            (Default: ``"min"``)

    Note:
        The LibriMix dataset needs to be manually generated. Please check https://github.com/JorisCos/LibriMix
