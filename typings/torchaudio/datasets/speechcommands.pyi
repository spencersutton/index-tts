    Args:
        root (str or Path): Path to the directory where the dataset is found or downloaded.
        url (str, optional): The URL to download the dataset from,
            or the type of the dataset to dowload.
            Allowed type values are ``"speech_commands_v0.01"`` and ``"speech_commands_v0.02"``
            (default: ``"speech_commands_v0.02"``)
        folder_in_archive (str, optional):
            The top-level directory of the dataset. (default: ``"SpeechCommands"``)
        download (bool, optional):
            Whether to download the dataset if it is not found at root path. (default: ``False``).
        subset (str or None, optional):
            Select a subset of the dataset [None, "training", "validation", "testing"]. None means
            the whole dataset. "validation" and "testing" are defined in "validation_list.txt" and
            "testing_list.txt", respectively, and "training" is the rest. Details for the files
            "validation_list.txt" and "testing_list.txt" are explained in the README of the dataset
            and in the introduction of Section 7 of the original paper and its reference 12. The
            original paper can be found `here <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03209.pdf>`_. (Default: ``None``)
