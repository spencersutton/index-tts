class WavLMSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    """Multi-headed self-attention for WavLM model :cite:`chen2022wavlm`.
    Wraps around ``torch.nn.MultiheadAttention``, creating relaive position embeddings and passing them to multi-headed
    attention as a mask.

        embed_dim (int): Total dimension of the model.
        num_heads (int): The number of heads.
        dropout (float, optional): Dropout probability on attn_output_weights. (Default: to ``0.0``)
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, add bias to input / output projection layers. (Default: ``True``)
        has_relative_attention_bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, apply relative position embedding.
            Necessary in the first encoder layer, but not in the subsequent ones. (Default: ``False``)
        num_buckets (int, optional): Number of buckets for relative position embedding. (Default: ``32``)
        max_distance (int, optional): Naximum distance for relative position embedding. (Default: ``128``)
