class SquimObjectiveBundle:
    """Data class that bundles associated information to use pretrained
    :py:class:`~torchaudio.models.SquimObjective` model.

    This class provides interfaces for instantiating the pretrained model along with
    the information necessary to retrieve pretrained weights and additional data
    to be used with the model.

    Torchaudio library instantiates objects of this class, each of which represents
    a different pretrained model. Client code should access pretrained models via these
    instances.

    This bundle can estimate objective metric scores for speech enhancement, such as STOI, PESQ, Si-SDR.
    A typical use case would be a flow like `waveform -> list of scores`. Please see below for the code example.

    Example: Estimate the objective metric scores for the input waveform.
