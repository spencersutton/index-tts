"""Module to change the configuration of libsox, which is used by I/O functions like
:py:mod:`~torchaudio.backend.sox_io_backend` and :py:mod:`~torchaudio.sox_effects`.

.. warning::
    Starting with version 2.8, we are refactoring TorchAudio to transition it
    into a maintenance phase. As a result:

    - Some APIs are deprecated in 2.8 and will be removed in 2.9.
    - The decoding and encoding capabilities of PyTorch for both audio and video
      are being consolidated into TorchCodec.

    Please see https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/3902 for more information.
