        Instantiate a type of [`~image_processing_utils.ImageProcessingMixin`] from an image processor.

        Args:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                This can be either:

                - a string, the *model id* of a pretrained image_processor hosted inside a model repo on
                  huggingface.co.
                - a path to a *directory* containing a image processor file saved using the
                  [`~image_processing_utils.ImageProcessingMixin.save_pretrained`] method, e.g.,
                  `./my_model_directory/`.
                - a path or url to a saved image processor JSON *file*, e.g.,
                  `./my_model_directory/preprocessor_config.json`.
            cache_dir (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model image processor should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force to (re-)download the image processor files and override the cached versions if
                they exist.
            resume_download:
                Deprecated and ignored. All downloads are now resumed by default when possible.
                Will be removed in v5 of Transformers.
            proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
            token (`str` or `bool`, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, or not specified, will use
                the token generated when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.


                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>"`.

                </Tip>

            return_unused_kwargs (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                If `False`, then this function returns just the final image processor object. If `True`, then this
                functions returns a `Tuple(image_processor, unused_kwargs)` where *unused_kwargs* is a dictionary
                consisting of the key/value pairs whose keys are not image processor attributes: i.e., the part of
                `kwargs` which has not been used to update `image_processor` and is otherwise ignored.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
                specify the folder name here.
            kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                The values in kwargs of any keys which are image processor attributes will be used to override the
                loaded values. Behavior concerning key/value pairs whose keys are *not* image processor attributes is
                controlled by the `return_unused_kwargs` keyword parameter.

        Returns:
            A image processor of type [`~image_processing_utils.ImageProcessingMixin`].
