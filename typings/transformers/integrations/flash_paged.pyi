    This function handles the cache updates and performs the attention computation
    using the flash_attn_varlen_func for efficient processing.

    Args:
        q: (total_q, nheads, headdim), where total_q = total number of query tokens in the batch.
        k: (total_k, nheads_k, headdim), where total_k = total number of key tokens in the batch.  but if there is a block table it can be the full k
        v: (total_k, nheads_k, headdim), where total_k = total number of key tokens in the batch.  but if there is a block table it can be the full v
        cumulative_seqlens_q: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths
           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into q.
        cumulative_seqlens_k: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths
           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into kv.
        max_seqlen_q: int. Maximum query sequence length in the batch.
        max_seqlen_k: int. Maximum key sequence length in the batch.
        dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
        softcap: float. Anything > 0 activates softcapping attention.
