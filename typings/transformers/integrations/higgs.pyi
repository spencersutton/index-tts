    Public method that recursively replaces the Linear layers of the given model with HIGGS quantized layers.
    `accelerate` is needed to use this method. Returns the converted model and a boolean that indicates if the
    conversion has been successful or not.

    Args:
        model (`torch.nn.Module`):
            The model to convert, can be any `torch.nn.Module` instance.
        quantization_config (`HiggsConfig`):
            The quantization config object that contains the quantization parameters.
        current_key_name (`list`, *optional*):
            A list that contains the current key name. This is used for recursion and should not be passed by the user.
