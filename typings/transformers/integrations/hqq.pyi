    Prepares nn.Linear layers for HQQ quantization.
    Since each layer type can have separate quantization parameters, we need to do the following:
    1- tag each module with its name via autoname_modules()
    2- Extract linear_tags (e.g. ['self_attn.q_proj', ...])
    3- Map quantization parameters as a dictionary linear_tag -> quant_params as HQQLinear expects it, this is referred to as patch_params
