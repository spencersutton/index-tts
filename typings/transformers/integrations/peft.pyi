class PeftAdapterMixin:
    """
    A class containing all functions for loading and using adapters weights that are supported in PEFT library. For
    more details about adapters and injecting them on a transformer-based model, check out the documentation of PEFT
    library: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index

    Currently supported PEFT methods are all non-prefix tuning methods. Below is the list of supported PEFT methods
    that anyone can load, train and run with this mixin class:
    - Low Rank Adapters (LoRA): https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora
    - IA3: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/ia3
    - AdaLora: https://huggingface.co/papers/2303.10512

    Other PEFT models such as prompt tuning, prompt learning are out of scope as these adapters are not "injectable"
    into a torch module. For using these methods, please refer to the usage guide of PEFT library.

    With this mixin, if the correct PEFT version is installed, it is possible to:

    - Load an adapter stored on a local path or in a remote Hub repository, and inject it in the model
    - Attach new adapters in the model and train them with Trainer or by your own.
    - Attach multiple adapters and iteratively activate / deactivate them
    - Activate / deactivate all adapters from the model.
    - Get the `state_dict` of the active adapter.

        Load adapter weights from file or remote Hub folder. If you are not familiar with adapters and PEFT methods, we
        invite you to read more about them on PEFT official documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft

        Requires peft as a backend to load the adapter weights.

        Args:
            peft_model_id (`str`, *optional*):
                The identifier of the model to look for on the Hub, or a local path to the saved adapter config file
                and adapter weights.
            adapter_name (`str`, *optional*):
                The adapter name to use. If not set, will use the default adapter.
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.

                <Tip>

                To test a pull request you made on the Hub, you can pass `revision="refs/pr/<pr_number>"`.

                </Tip>

            token (`str`, `optional`):
                Whether to use authentication token to load the remote folder. Useful to load private repositories
                that are on HuggingFace Hub. You might need to call `hf auth login` and paste your tokens to
                cache it.
            device_map (`str` or `dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]` or `int` or `torch.device`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesn't need to be refined to each
                parameter/buffer name, once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device. If we only pass the device (*e.g.*, `"cpu"`, `"cuda:1"`, `"mps"`, or a GPU ordinal rank
                like `1`) on which the model will be allocated, the device map will map the entire model to this
                device. Passing `device_map = 0` means put the whole model on GPU 0.

                To have Accelerate compute the most optimized `device_map` automatically, set `device_map="auto"`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier to maximum memory. Will default to the maximum memory available for each
                GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, `optional`):
                If the `device_map` contains any value `"disk"`, the folder where we will offload weights.
            offload_index (`int`, `optional`):
                `offload_index` argument to be passed to `accelerate.dispatch_model` method.
            peft_config (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                The configuration of the adapter to add, supported adapters are non-prefix tuning and adaption prompts
                methods. This argument is used in case users directly pass PEFT state dicts
            adapter_state_dict (`dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, *optional*):
                The state dict of the adapter to load. This argument is used in case users directly pass PEFT state
                dicts
            low_cpu_mem_usage (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Reduce memory usage while loading the PEFT adapter. This should also speed up the loading process.
                Requires PEFT version 0.13.0 or higher.
            is_trainable (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether the adapter should be trainable or not. If `False`, the adapter will be frozen and can only be
                used for inference.
            adapter_kwargs (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
                Additional keyword arguments passed along to the `from_pretrained` method of the adapter config and
                `find_adapter_config_file` method.
