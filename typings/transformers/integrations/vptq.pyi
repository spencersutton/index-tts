    """
    Public method that recursively replaces the Linear layers of the given model with VPTQ quantized layers.
    `accelerate` is needed to use this method. Returns the converted model and a boolean that indicates if the
    conversion has been successful or not.

    Args:
        model (`torch.nn.Module`):
            The model to convert, can be any `torch.nn.Module` instance.
        quantization_config (`VptqConfig`):
            The quantization config object that contains the quantization parameters.
        modules_to_not_convert (`list[`str`]`, *optional*, defaults to `["lm_head"]`):
            Names of the modules to not convert in `VQuantLinear`. In practice we keep the `lm_head` in full precision
            for numerical stability reasons.
        current_key_name (`list`, *optional*):
            A list that contains the current key name. This is used for recursion and should not be passed by the user.
        has_been_replaced (`bool`, *optional*):
            A boolean that indicates if the conversion has been successful or not. This is used for recursion and
            should not be passed by the user.
