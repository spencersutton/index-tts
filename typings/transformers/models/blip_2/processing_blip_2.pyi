    Constructs a BLIP-2 processor which wraps a BLIP image processor and an OPT/T5 tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`BlipProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`BlipImageProcessor`] and [`AutoTokenizer`]. See the docstring
    of [`~BlipProcessor.__call__`] and [`~BlipProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor (`BlipImageProcessor`):
            An instance of [`BlipImageProcessor`]. The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`AutoTokenizer`):
            An instance of ['PreTrainedTokenizer`]. The tokenizer is a required input.
        num_query_tokens (`int`, *optional*):
            Number of tokens used by the Qformer as queries, should be same as in model's config.

        This method uses [`BlipImageProcessor.__call__`] method to prepare image(s) for the model, and
        [`BertTokenizerFast.__call__`] to prepare text for the model.

        Please refer to the docstring of the above two methods for more information.
        Args:
            images (`ImageInput`):
                The image or batch of images to be prepared. Each image can be a PIL image, NumPy array or PyTorch
                tensor. Both channels-first and channels-last formats are supported.
            text (`TextInput`, `PreTokenizedInput`, `list[TextInput]`, `list[PreTokenizedInput]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
                (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized), you must set
                `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Acceptable values are:
                    - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                    - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                    - `'np'`: Return NumPy `np.ndarray` objects.
                    - `'jax'`: Return JAX `jnp.ndarray` objects.
