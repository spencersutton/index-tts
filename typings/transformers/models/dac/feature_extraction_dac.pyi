    Constructs an Dac feature extractor.

    This feature extractor inherits from [`~feature_extraction_sequence_utils.SequenceFeatureExtractor`] which contains
    most of the main methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        feature_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The feature dimension of the extracted features. Use 1 for mono, 2 for stereo.
        sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16000):
            The sampling rate at which the audio waveform should be digitalized, expressed in hertz (Hz).
        padding_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The value that is used for padding.
        hop_length (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            Overlap length between successive windows.

        Main method to featurize and prepare for the model one or several sequence(s).

        Args:
            raw_audio (`np.ndarray`, `list[float]`, `list[np.ndarray]`, `list[list[float]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be processed. Each sequence can be a numpy array, a list of float
                values, a list of numpy arrays or a list of list of float values. The numpy array must be of shape
                `(num_samples,)` for mono audio (`feature_size = 1`), or `(2, num_samples)` for stereo audio
                (`feature_size = 2`).
            padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
                index) among:

                - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
                  sequence if provided).
                - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
                  acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
                - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
                  lengths).
            truncation (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Activates truncation to cut input sequences longer than `max_length` to `max_length`.
            max_length (`int`, *optional*):
                Maximum length of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*, default to 'pt'):
                If set, will return tensors instead of list of python integers. Acceptable values are:

                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return Numpy `np.ndarray` objects.
            sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*):
                The sampling rate at which the `audio` input was sampled. It is strongly recommended to pass
                `sampling_rate` at the forward call to prevent silent errors.
