class HGNetV2Config(BackboneConfigMixin, PretrainedConfig):
    """
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`HGNetV2Backbone`]. It is used to instantiate a HGNet-V2
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of D-FINE-X-COCO B4 "[ustc-community/dfine_x_coco"](https://huggingface.co/ustc-community/dfine_x_coco").
    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        num_channels (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 3):
            The number of input channels.
        embedding_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 64):
            Dimensionality (hidden size) for the embedding layer.
        depths (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[3, 4, 6, 3]`):
            Depth (number of layers) for each stage.
        hidden_sizes (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[256, 512, 1024, 2048]`):
            Dimensionality (hidden size) at each stage.
        hidden_act (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"relu"`):
            The non-linear activation function in each block. If string, `"gelu"`, `"relu"`, `"selu"` and `"gelu_new"`
            are supported.
        out_features (`list[str]`, *optional*):
            If used as backbone, list of features to output. Can be any of `"stem"`, `"stage1"`, `"stage2"`, etc.
            (depending on how many stages the model has). If unset and `out_indices` is set, will default to the
            corresponding stages. If unset and `out_indices` is unset, will default to the last stage. Must be in the
            same order as defined in the `stage_names` attribute.
        out_indices (`list[int]`, *optional*):
            If used as backbone, list of indices of features to output. Can be any of 0, 1, 2, etc. (depending on how
            many stages the model has). If unset and `out_features` is set, will default to the corresponding stages.
            If unset and `out_features` is unset, will default to the last stage. Must be in the
            same order as defined in the `stage_names` attribute.
        stem_channels (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[3, 32, 48]`):
            Channel dimensions for the stem layers:
            - First number (3) is input image channels
            - Second number (32) is intermediate stem channels
            - Third number (48) is output stem channels
        stage_in_channels (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[48, 128, 512, 1024]`):
            Input channel dimensions for each stage of the backbone.
            This defines how many channels the input to each stage will have.
        stage_mid_channels (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[48, 96, 192, 384]`):
            Mid-channel dimensions for each stage of the backbone.
            This defines the number of channels used in the intermediate layers of each stage.
        stage_out_channels (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[128, 512, 1024, 2048]`):
            Output channel dimensions for each stage of the backbone.
            This defines how many channels the output of each stage will have.
        stage_num_blocks (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[1, 1, 3, 1]`):
            Number of blocks to be used in each stage of the backbone.
            This controls the depth of each stage by specifying how many convolutional blocks to stack.
        stage_downsample (`list[bool]`, *optional*, defaults to `[False, True, True, True]`):
            Indicates whether to downsample the feature maps at each stage.
            If `True`, the spatial dimensions of the feature maps will be reduced.
        stage_light_block (`list[bool]`, *optional*, defaults to `[False, False, True, True]`):
            Indicates whether to use light blocks in each stage.
            Light blocks are a variant of convolutional blocks that may have fewer parameters.
        stage_kernel_size (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[3, 3, 5, 5]`):
            Kernel sizes for the convolutional layers in each stage.
        stage_numb_of_layers (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[6, 6, 6, 6]`):
            Number of layers to be used in each block of the stage.
        use_learnable_affine_block (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use Learnable Affine Blocks (LAB) in the network.
            LAB adds learnable scale and bias parameters after certain operations.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
