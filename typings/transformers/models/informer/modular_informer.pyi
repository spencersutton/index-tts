        past_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`):
            Past values of the time series, that serve as context in order to predict the future. The sequence size of
            this tensor must be larger than the `context_length` of the model, since the model will use the larger size
            to construct lag features, i.e. additional values from the past which are added in order to serve as "extra
            context".

            The `sequence_length` here is equal to `config.context_length` + `max(config.lags_sequence)`, which if no
            `lags_sequence` is configured, is equal to `config.context_length` + 7 (as by default, the largest
            look-back index in `config.lags_sequence` is 7). The property `_past_length` returns the actual length of
            the past.

            The `past_values` is what the Transformer encoder gets as input (with optional additional features, such as
            `static_categorical_features`, `static_real_features`, `past_time_features` and lags).

            Optionally, missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the `past_observed_mask`.

            For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of
            variates in the time series per time step.
        past_time_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features)`):
            Required time features, which the model internally will add to `past_values`. These could be things like
            "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These
            could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at which point in life" a
            time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the
            more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.

            These features serve as the "positional encodings" of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where
            the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series
            Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns
            additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.

            Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features
            must but known at prediction time.

            The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num_time_features` + `config.num_dynamic_real_features`.
        past_observed_mask (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, *optional*):
            Boolean mask to indicate which `past_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in
            `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 for values that are **observed**,
            - 0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
        static_categorical_features (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static categorical features)`, *optional*):
            Optional static categorical features for which the model will learn an embedding, which it will add to the
            values of the time series.

            Static categorical features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

            A typical example of a static categorical feature is a time series ID.
        static_real_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static real features)`, *optional*):
            Optional static real features which the model will add to the values of the time series.

            Static real features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).

            A typical example of a static real feature is promotion information.
        future_values (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length)` or `(batch_size, prediction_length, input_size)`, *optional*):
            Future values of the time series, that serve as labels for the model. The `future_values` is what the
            Transformer needs during training to learn to output, given the `past_values`.

            The sequence length here is equal to `prediction_length`.

            See the demo notebook and code snippets for details.

            Optionally, during training any missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the
            `future_observed_mask`.

            For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of
            variates in the time series per time step.
        future_time_features (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length, num_features)`):
            Required time features for the prediction window, which the model internally will add to `future_values`.
            These could be things like "month of year", "day of the month", etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as
            Fourier features). These could also be so-called "age" features, which basically help the model know "at
            which point in life" a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and

            The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num_time_features` + `config.num_dynamic_real_features`.
        cross_attn_head_mask (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, *optional*):
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

            - 1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
            - 0 indicates the head is **masked**.
        encoder_outputs (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*):
            Tuple consists of `last_hidden_state`, `hidden_states` (*optional*) and `attentions` (*optional*)
            `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` (*optional*) is a sequence of
            hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
