    Constructs an InstructBLIP processor which wraps a BLIP image processor and a LLaMa/T5 tokenizer into a single
    processor.

    [`InstructBlipProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`BlipImageProcessor`] and [`AutoTokenizer`]. See the
    docstring of [`~BlipProcessor.__call__`] and [`~BlipProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor (`BlipImageProcessor`):
            An instance of [`BlipImageProcessor`]. The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`AutoTokenizer`):
            An instance of ['PreTrainedTokenizer`]. The tokenizer is a required input.
        qformer_tokenizer (`AutoTokenizer`):
            An instance of ['PreTrainedTokenizer`]. The Q-Former tokenizer is a required input.
        num_query_tokens (`int`, *optional*):"
            Number of tokens used by the Qformer as queries, should be same as in model's config.
