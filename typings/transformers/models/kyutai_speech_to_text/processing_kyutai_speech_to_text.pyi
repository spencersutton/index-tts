    Constructs a Moshi ASR processor which wraps [`EncodecFeatureExtractor`] and

    tokenizer functionalities. See the [`~KyutaiSpeechToTextProcessor.__call__`] for more

        r"""
        Main method to prepare audio to be fed as input to the model. This method forwards the `audio`
        arguments to KyutaiSpeechToTextFeatureExtractor's [`~KyutaiSpeechToTextFeatureExtractor.__call__`]. Please refer
        to the docstring of the above method for more information.

        Args:
            audio (`np.ndarray`, `torch.Tensor`, `list[np.ndarray]`, `list[torch.Tensor]`):
                The audio or batch of audio to be prepared. Each audio can be a NumPy array or PyTorch
                tensor.
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Acceptable values are:
                    - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.constant` objects.
                    - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                    - `'np'`: Return NumPy `np.ndarray` objects.
                    - `'jax'`: Return JAX `jnp.ndarray` objects.
        Returns:
            [`BatchFeature`]: A [`BatchFeature`] with the following fields:

            - **input_values** -- List of audio values to be fed to a model. Returned when `audio` is not `None`.
            - **padding_mask** -- List of indices specifying which input values should be ignored by the model.
