class LlavaNextProcessor(ProcessorMixin):
    r"""
    Constructs a LLaVa-NeXT processor which wraps a LLaVa-NeXT image processor and a LLaMa tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`LlavaNextProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`LlavaNextImageProcessor`] and [`LlamaTokenizerFast`]. See the
    [`~LlavaNextProcessor.__call__`] and [`~LlavaNextProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor ([`LlavaNextImageProcessor`], *optional*):
            The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`LlamaTokenizerFast`], *optional*):
            The tokenizer is a required input.
        patch_size (`int`, *optional*):
            Patch size from the vision tower.
        vision_feature_select_strategy (`str`, *optional*):
            The feature selection strategy used to select the vision feature from the vision backbone.
            Should be same as in model's config
        chat_template (`str`, *optional*): A Jinja template which will be used to convert lists of messages
            in a chat into a tokenizable string.
        image_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<image>"`):
            Special token used to denote image location.
        num_additional_image_tokens (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            Number of additional tokens added to the image embeddings, such as CLS (+1). If the backbone has no CLS or other
            extra tokens appended, no need to set this arg.

        Main method to prepare for the model one or several sequences(s) and image(s). This method forwards the `text`
        and `kwargs` arguments to LlamaTokenizerFast's [`~LlamaTokenizerFast.__call__`] if `text` is not `None` to encode
        the text. To prepare the image(s), this method forwards the `images` and `kwrags` arguments to
        LlavaNextImageProcessor's [`~LlavaNextImageProcessor.__call__`] if `images` is not `None`. Please refer to the docstring
        of the above two methods for more information.

        Args:
            images (`PIL.Image.Image`, `np.ndarray`, `torch.Tensor`, `list[PIL.Image.Image]`, `list[np.ndarray]`, `list[torch.Tensor]`):
                The image or batch of images to be prepared. Each image can be a PIL image, NumPy array or PyTorch
                tensor. Both channels-first and channels-last formats are supported.
            text (`str`, `list[str]`, `list[list[str]]`):
                The sequence or batch of sequences to be encoded. Each sequence can be a string or a list of strings
                (pretokenized string). If the sequences are provided as list of strings (pretokenized), you must set
                `is_split_into_words=True` (to lift the ambiguity with a batch of sequences).

        Returns:
            [`BatchFeature`]: A [`BatchFeature`] with the following fields:

            - **input_ids** -- List of token ids to be fed to a model. Returned when `text` is not `None`.
            - **attention_mask** -- List of indices specifying which tokens should be attended to by the model (when
              `return_attention_mask=True` or if *"attention_mask"* is in `self.model_input_names` and if `text` is not
              `None`).
            - **pixel_values** -- Pixel values to be fed to a model. Returned when `images` is not `None`.
