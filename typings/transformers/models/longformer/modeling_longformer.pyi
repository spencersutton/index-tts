    Longformer self-attention combines a local (sliding window) and global attention to extend to long documents

    The self-attention module `LongformerSelfAttention` implemented here supports the combination of local and global
    attention but it lacks support for autoregressive attention and dilated attention. Autoregressive and dilated
    attention are more relevant for autoregressive language modeling than finetuning on downstream tasks. Future
    release will add support for autoregressive attention, but the support for dilated attention requires a custom CUDA
    kernel to be memory and compute efficient.
