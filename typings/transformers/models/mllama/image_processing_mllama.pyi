def get_optimal_tiled_canvas(
    image_height: int, image_width: int, max_image_tiles: int, tile_size: int
) -> tuple[int, int]:
    r"""
    Determines the best canvas based on image and tile size and maximum number of tiles.

    First, calculates possible resolutions based on the maximum number of tiles and tile size.
    For example for max_image_tiles=2, tile_size=100, possible tile arrangements are:
    [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)] and corresponding canvas sizes are:
    [(100, 100), (100, 200), (200, 100)]

    For each possible resolution, calculates the scaling factors for
    width and height, and selects the smallest one, which is the limiting side.
    E.g. to match the canvas you can upscale height by 2x, and width by 1.5x,
    therefore, the maximum upscaling you can do is min(2, 1.5) = 1.5.

    If upscaling is possible (any of the scaling factors is greater than 1),
    then picks the smallest upscaling factor > 1.

    If upscaling is not possible, then picks the largest scaling factor <= 1, i.e.
    reduce downscaling as much as possible.

    If there are multiple resolutions with the same max scale, we pick the one with the lowest area,
    to minimize padding. E.g., the same image can be upscaled to 224x224 and 224x448, but the latter
    has more padding.

    Example of canvases made from tiles:

    To visualize how the image can fit onto different tile grids, let's try fitting an ASCII cat into the tiles.

    Here's an ASCII cat image you want to fit into the tiles:

       /\_/\
      ( o.o )
       > ^ <

    If `num_tiles=6`, possible tile grids would look like this:

    **2x3 Canvas (2 tiles wide, 3 tiles tall)**: -> total of 6 tiles
    +-------+-------+
    | /\_/\ |   0   |   <- Cat image split across two tiles horizontally
    +-------+-------+
    | > ^ < |   0   |   <- Remaining part of the cat occupies the left tile
    +-------+-------+
    |( o.o )|   0   |
    +-------+-------+

    **3x2 Canvas (3 tiles wide, 2 tiles tall)**: -> total of 6 tiles
    +-------+-------+-------+
    | /\_/\ |( o.o )|   0   |   <- Cat image occupies the first two tiles, 1 tile remains empty
    +-------+-------+-------+
    | > ^ < |   0   |   0   |   <- Remaining part of the cat occupies the left tile
    +-------+-------+-------+

    **1x6 Canvas (1 tile wide, 6 tiles tall)**: -> total of 6 tiles
    +-------+
    | /\_/\ |   <- Top part of the cat
    +-------+
    |( o.o )|   <- Middle part of the cat
    +-------+
    | > ^ < |   <- Bottom part of the cat
    +-------+
    |   0   |
    +-------+
    |   0   |
    +-------+
    |   0   |
    +-------+

    Given that the tiles you get depend on the chosen aspect ratio, you have to add
    embedding in the modeling code to help it know if it got a 3x2 or a 1x6 or a 2x3
    aspect ratio.

    The function tests these arrangements to find the smallest canvas where the image fits.
    If multiple canvases fit, it selects the one where the dimensions are closest to the image size.

    In this case the first canvas is the closest to the original image.

    You then feed all of the tiles to the model:

        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    -   | /\_/\ |( o.o )| > ^ < |   0   |   0   |   0   |  <- Last canvas
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    -   | /\_/\ | 0     |( o.o )|   0   | > ^ < |   0   | <- First canvas
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
    -   | /\_/\ |( o.o )|   0   | > ^ < |   0   |   0   | <- second canvas
        +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

    For each tile, you have num_channels (usually RGB so 3), tile_width, tile_height

        image_height (`int`):
            The height of the image.

        Resizes an image to fit within a tiled canvas while maintaining its aspect ratio.
        The optimal canvas size is calculated based on the maximum number of tiles and the tile size.

        The function first determines the best tile arrangement for the image, then resizes the image
        to fit within this canvas. The resized image and the number of tiles along the height and width
        dimensions are returned.

        Args:
            image (`np.ndarray`):
                Image to resize.
            size (`dict[str, int]`):
                Size of the output image.
            max_image_tiles (`int`):
                The maximum number of tiles to split the image into.
            resample (`PILImageResampling`, *optional*, defaults to `PILImageResampling.BICUBIC`):
                Resampling filter to use when resizing the image.
            data_format (`str` or `ChannelDimension`, *optional*):
                The channel dimension format of the image. If not provided, it will be the same as the input image.
            input_data_format (`ChannelDimension` or `str`, *optional*):
                The channel dimension format of the input image. If not provided, it will be inferred.

        Returns:
            `Union[np.ndarray, tuple[int, int]]`: The resized image and a tuple containing the number of tiles
            along the height and width dimensions.
