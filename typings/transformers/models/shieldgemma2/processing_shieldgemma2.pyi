        ShieldGemma was trained to classify image content for policy compliance using a specific prompt construction.
        This processor generates a batch of such prompts from the provided images by:

        1.  Creating a list of conversations, one for each `<image, policy>` pair;
        2.  Converting these conversations to text using `self.apply_chat_template()`; and
        3.  Encoding the conversations and images using the same techniques as `Gemma3Processor`.

        Args:
            images: A single image or a list of images to include in the batch.
            text: Not supported.
            videos: Not supported.
            audio: Not supported.
            kwargs: An optional dictionary of keyword arguments to configure the
                processor. Possible values include:

                *   `custom_policies`: Additional policy definitions that augment the `self.policy_definitions` passed
                    into the constructor. Note that `custom_policies` that share a key with `self.policy_definitions`
                    will override the policy description
                *   `policies`: (Optional) a list of keys in the joint `self.policy_definitions | custom_policies`
                    dictionary of specific interest for the provided images. If empty or None, prompts will be
                    generated for every key in the joint dictionary.

        Returns:
            A `BatchFeature` containing `input_ids`, `pixel_values`, etc. where each Tensor is of shape
            `(len(images) * len(policies), )`, and the order within the batch will be
