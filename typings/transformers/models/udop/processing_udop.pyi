class UdopProcessor(ProcessorMixin):
    r"""
    Constructs a UDOP processor which combines a LayoutLMv3 image processor and a UDOP tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`UdopProcessor`] offers all the functionalities you need to prepare data for the model.

    It first uses [`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`] to resize, rescale and normalize document images, and optionally applies OCR
    to get words and normalized bounding boxes. These are then provided to [`UdopTokenizer`] or [`UdopTokenizerFast`],
    which turns the words and bounding boxes into token-level `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`, `bbox`.
    Optionally, one can provide integer `word_labels`, which are turned into token-level `labels` for token
    classification tasks (such as FUNSD, CORD).

    Additionally, it also supports passing `text_target` and `text_pair_target` to the tokenizer, which can be used to
    prepare labels for language modeling tasks.

    Args:
        image_processor (`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`):
            An instance of [`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`]. The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`UdopTokenizer` or `UdopTokenizerFast`):
            An instance of [`UdopTokenizer`] or [`UdopTokenizerFast`]. The tokenizer is a required input.

        This method first forwards the `images` argument to [`~UdopImageProcessor.__call__`]. In case
