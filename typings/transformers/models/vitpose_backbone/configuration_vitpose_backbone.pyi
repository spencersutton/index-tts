class VitPoseBackboneConfig(BackboneConfigMixin, PretrainedConfig):
    r"""
    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`VitPoseBackbone`]. It is used to instantiate a
    VitPose model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the VitPose
    [usyd-community/vitpose-base-simple](https://huggingface.co/usyd-community/vitpose-base-simple) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to `[256, 192]`):
            The size (resolution) of each image.
        patch_size (`list[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[16, 16]`):
            The size (resolution) of each patch.
        num_channels (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 3):
            The number of input channels.
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 768):
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 12):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 12):
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer encoder.
        mlp_ratio (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4):
            The ratio of the hidden size in the feedforward network to the hidden size in the attention layers.
        num_experts (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The number of experts in the MoE layer.
        part_features (`int`, *optional*):
            The number of part features to output. Only used in case `num_experts` is greater than 1.
        hidden_act (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"gelu"`):
            The non-linear activation function in the encoder and pooler. If string, `"gelu"`,
            `"relu"`, `"selu"` and `"gelu_new"` are supported.
        hidden_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The dropout probabilitiy for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_probs_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        layer_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-12):
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.
        qkv_bias (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to add a bias to the queries, keys and values.
        out_features (`list[str]`, *optional*):
            If used as backbone, list of features to output. Can be any of `"stem"`, `"stage1"`, `"stage2"`, etc.
            (depending on how many stages the model has). If unset and `out_indices` is set, will default to the
            corresponding stages. If unset and `out_indices` is unset, will default to the last stage. Must be in the
            same order as defined in the `stage_names` attribute.
        out_indices (`list[int]`, *optional*):
            If used as backbone, list of indices of features to output. Can be any of 0, 1, 2, etc. (depending on how
            many stages the model has). If unset and `out_features` is set, will default to the corresponding stages.
            If unset and `out_features` is unset, will default to the last stage. Must be in the
            same order as defined in the `stage_names` attribute.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import VitPoseBackboneConfig, VitPoseBackbone

    >>> # Initializing a VitPose configuration
    >>> configuration = VitPoseBackboneConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
    >>> model = VitPoseBackbone(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
