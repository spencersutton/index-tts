    Constructs a ZoeDepth image processor.

    Args:
        do_pad (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to apply pad the input.
        do_rescale (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to rescale the image by the specified scale `rescale_factor`. Can be overridden by `do_rescale` in
            `preprocess`.
        rescale_factor (`int` or `float`, *optional*, defaults to `1/255`):
            Scale factor to use if rescaling the image. Can be overridden by `rescale_factor` in `preprocess`.
        do_normalize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to normalize the image. Can be overridden by the `do_normalize` parameter in the `preprocess`
            method.
        image_mean (`float` or `list[float]`, *optional*, defaults to `IMAGENET_STANDARD_MEAN`):
            Mean to use if normalizing the image. This is a float or list of floats the length of the number of
            channels in the image. Can be overridden by the `image_mean` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        image_std (`float` or `list[float]`, *optional*, defaults to `IMAGENET_STANDARD_STD`):
            Standard deviation to use if normalizing the image. This is a float or list of floats the length of the
            number of channels in the image. Can be overridden by the `image_std` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        do_resize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to resize the image's (height, width) dimensions. Can be overridden by `do_resize` in `preprocess`.
        size (`dict[str, int]` *optional*, defaults to `{"height": 384, "width": 512}`):
            Size of the image after resizing. Size of the image after resizing. If `keep_aspect_ratio` is `True`,
            the image is resized by choosing the smaller of the height and width scaling factors and using it for both dimensions.
            If `ensure_multiple_of` is also set, the image is further resized to a size that is a multiple of this value.
            Can be overridden by `size` in `preprocess`.
        resample (`PILImageResampling`, *optional*, defaults to `Resampling.BILINEAR`):
            Defines the resampling filter to use if resizing the image. Can be overridden by `resample` in `preprocess`.
        keep_aspect_ratio (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If `True`, the image is resized by choosing the smaller of the height and width scaling factors and using it
            for both dimensions. This ensures that the image is scaled down as little as possible while still fitting
            within the desired output size. In case `ensure_multiple_of` is also set, the image is further resized to a
            size that is a multiple of this value by flooring the height and width to the nearest multiple of this value.
            Can be overridden by `keep_aspect_ratio` in `preprocess`.
        ensure_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            If `do_resize` is `True`, the image is resized to a size that is a multiple of this value. Works by flooring
            the height and width to the nearest multiple of this value.

            Works both with and without `keep_aspect_ratio` being set to `True`. Can be overridden by `ensure_multiple_of`
            in `preprocess`.
