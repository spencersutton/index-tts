    This function chunks the `input_tensors` into smaller input tensor parts of size `chunk_size` over the dimension
    `chunk_dim`. It then applies a layer `forward_fn` to each chunk independently to save memory.

    If the `forward_fn` is independent across the `chunk_dim` this function will yield the same result as directly
    applying `forward_fn` to `input_tensors`.

    Args:
        forward_fn (`Callable[..., torch.Tensor]`):
            The forward function of the model.

            The chunk size of a chunked tensor: `num_chunks = len(input_tensors[0]) / chunk_size`.
        chunk_dim (`int`):
            The dimension over which the `input_tensors` should be chunked.
        input_tensors (`tuple[torch.Tensor]`):

    Returns:
        `torch.Tensor`: A tensor with the same shape as the `forward_fn` would have given if applied`.
