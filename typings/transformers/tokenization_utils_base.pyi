        Add a dictionary of special tokens (eos, pad, cls, etc.) to the encoder and link them to class attributes. If
        special tokens are NOT in the vocabulary, they are added to it (indexed starting from the last index of the
        current vocabulary).

        When adding new tokens to the vocabulary, you should make sure to also resize the token embedding matrix of the
        model so that its embedding matrix matches the tokenizer.

        In order to do that, please use the [`~PreTrainedModel.resize_token_embeddings`] method.

        Using `add_special_tokens` will ensure your special tokens can be used in several ways:

        - Special tokens can be skipped when decoding using `skip_special_tokens = True`.
        - Special tokens are carefully handled by the tokenizer (they are never split), similar to `AddedTokens`.
        - You can easily refer to special tokens using tokenizer class attributes like `tokenizer.cls_token`. This
          makes it easy to develop model-agnostic training and fine-tuning scripts.

        When possible, special tokens are already registered for provided pretrained models (for instance
        [`BertTokenizer`] `cls_token` is already registered to be `'[CLS]'` and XLM's one is also registered to be
        `'</s>'`).

        Args:
            special_tokens_dict (dictionary *str* to *str*, `tokenizers.AddedToken`, or `Sequence[Union[str, AddedToken]]`):
                Keys should be in the list of predefined special attributes: [`bos_token`, `eos_token`, `unk_token`,
                `sep_token`, `pad_token`, `cls_token`, `mask_token`, `additional_special_tokens`].

                Tokens are only added if they are not already in the vocabulary (tested by checking if the tokenizer
                assign the index of the `unk_token` to them).
            replace_additional_special_tokens (`bool`, *optional*,, defaults to `True`):
                If `True`, the existing list of additional special tokens will be replaced by the list provided in
                `special_tokens_dict`. Otherwise, `self._special_tokens_map["additional_special_tokens"]` is just extended. In the former
                case, the tokens will NOT be removed from the tokenizer's full vocabulary - they are only being flagged
                as non-special tokens. Remember, this only affects which tokens are skipped during decoding, not the
                `added_tokens_encoder` and `added_tokens_decoder`. This means that the previous
                `additional_special_tokens` are still added tokens, and will not be split by the model.

        Returns:
            `int`: Number of tokens added to the vocabulary.

                (retrieval-augmented generation). If the template does not support RAG, this argument will have no

                for examples of passing documents with chat templates.
            chat_template (`str`, *optional*):
                A Jinja template to use for this conversion. It is usually not necessary to pass anything to this
                argument, as the model's template will be used by default.

                If this is set, a prompt with the token(s) that indicate
                the start of an assistant message will be appended to the formatted output. This is useful when you want to generate a response from the model.
                Note that this argument will be passed to the chat template, and so it must be supported in the
                template for this argument to have any effect.

                the model's response for it. Cannot be used at the same time as `add_generation_prompt`.
            tokenize (`bool`, defaults to `True`):
                Whether to tokenize the output. If `False`, the output will be a string.

                 Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
                 index) among:

                - `True` or `'longest'`: Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
                  sequence if provided).
                - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
                  acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
                - `False` or `'do_not_pad'` (default): No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
                  lengths).
            truncation (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to truncate sequences at the maximum length. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`.
            max_length (`int`, *optional*):
                Maximum length (in tokens) to use for padding or truncation. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`. If
                not specified, the tokenizer's `max_length` attribute will be used as a default.
            return_tensors (`str` or [`~utils.TensorType`], *optional*):
                If set, will return tensors of a particular framework. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`. Acceptable
                values are:
                - `'tf'`: Return TensorFlow `tf.Tensor` objects.
                - `'pt'`: Return PyTorch `torch.Tensor` objects.
                - `'np'`: Return NumPy `np.ndarray` objects.
                - `'jax'`: Return JAX `jnp.ndarray` objects.
            return_dict (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to return a dictionary with named outputs. Has no effect if tokenize is `False`.
            tokenizer_kwargs (`dict[str: Any]`, *optional*): Additional kwargs to pass to the tokenizer.
            return_assistant_tokens_mask (`bool`, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to return a mask of the assistant generated tokens. For tokens generated by the assistant,
                the mask will contain 1. For user and system tokens, the mask will contain 0.
                This functionality is only available for chat templates that support it via the `{% generation %}` keyword.

        Instantiate a [`~tokenization_utils_base.PreTrainedTokenizerBase`] (or a derived class) from a predefined
        tokenizer.

        Args:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
                Can be either:

                - A string, the *model id* of a predefined tokenizer hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.
                - A path to a *directory* containing vocabulary files required by the tokenizer, for instance saved
                  using the [`~tokenization_utils_base.PreTrainedTokenizerBase.save_pretrained`] method, e.g.,
                  `./my_model_directory/`.
                - (**Deprecated**, not applicable to all derived classes) A path or url to a single saved vocabulary
                  file (if and only if the tokenizer only requires a single vocabulary file like Bert or XLNet), e.g.,
                  `./my_model_directory/vocab.txt`.
            cache_dir (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded predefined tokenizer vocabulary files should be cached if the
                standard cache should not be used.
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download the vocabulary files and override the cached versions if they
                exist.
            resume_download:
                Deprecated and ignored. All downloads are now resumed by default when possible.
                Will be removed in v5 of Transformers.
            proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, will use the token generated
                when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
            local_files_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to only rely on local files and not to attempt to download any files.
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
                git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
                identifier allowed by git.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*):
                In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co (e.g. for
                facebook/rag-token-base), specify it here.
            inputs (additional positional arguments, *optional*):
                Will be passed along to the Tokenizer `__init__` method.
            trust_remote_code (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to allow for custom models defined on the Hub in their own modeling files. This option
                should only be set to `True` for repositories you trust and in which you have read the code, as it will
                execute code present on the Hub on your local machine.
            kwargs (additional keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Will be passed to the Tokenizer `__init__` method. Can be used to set special tokens like `bos_token`,
                `eos_token`, `unk_token`, `sep_token`, `pad_token`, `cls_token`, `mask_token`,
                `additional_special_tokens`. See parameters in the `__init__` for more details.

        <Tip>

        Passing `token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

        text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.

        <Tip>

        If the `encoded_inputs` passed are dictionary of numpy arrays, PyTorch tensors or TensorFlow tensors, the
        result will use the same type unless you provide a different tensor type with `return_tensors`. In the case of
        PyTorch tensors, you will lose the specific device of your tensors however.

        </Tip>

        Args:
            encoded_inputs ([`BatchEncoding`], list of [`BatchEncoding`], `dict[str, list[int]]`, `dict[str, list[list[int]]` or `list[dict[str, list[int]]]`):
                Tokenized inputs. Can represent one input ([`BatchEncoding`] or `dict[str, list[int]]`) or a batch of
                tokenized inputs (list of [`BatchEncoding`], *dict[str, list[list[int]]]* or *list[dict[str,
                list[int]]]*) so you can use this method during preprocessing as well as in a PyTorch Dataloader
                collate function.

                Instead of `list[int]` you can have tensors (numpy arrays, PyTorch tensors or TensorFlow tensors), see
                the note above for the return type.
            padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                 Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding
                 index) among:

                - `True` or `'longest'` (default): Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
                  sequence if provided).
                - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
                  acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
                - `False` or `'do_not_pad'`: No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different
                  lengths).
            max_length (`int`, *optional*):
                Maximum length of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).
            pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
                If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

                This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability
                `>= 7.5` (Volta).
            padding_side (`str`, *optional*):
                The side on which the model should have padding applied. Should be selected between ['right', 'left'].
                Default value is picked from the class attribute of the same name.
            return_attention_mask (`bool`, *optional*):
                Whether to return the attention mask. If left to the default, will return the attention mask according
                to the specific tokenizer's default, defined by the `return_outputs` attribute.
