class BitsAndBytesConfig(QuantizationConfigMixin):
    """
    This is a wrapper class about all possible attributes and features that you can play with a model that has been
    loaded using `bitsandbytes`.

    This replaces `load_in_8bit` or `load_in_4bit`therefore both options are mutually exclusive.

    Currently only supports `LLM.int8()`, `FP4`, and `NF4` quantization. If more methods are added to `bitsandbytes`,
    then more arguments will be added to this class.

    Args:
        load_in_8bit (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used to enable 8-bit quantization with LLM.int8().
        load_in_4bit (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used to enable 4-bit quantization by replacing the Linear layers with FP4/NF4 layers from
            `bitsandbytes`.
        llm_int8_threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 6.0):
            This corresponds to the outlier threshold for outlier detection as described in `LLM.int8() : 8-bit Matrix
            Multiplication for Transformers at Scale` paper: https://huggingface.co/papers/2208.07339 Any hidden states value
            that is above this threshold will be considered an outlier and the operation on those values will be done
            in fp16. Values are usually normally distributed, that is, most values are in the range [-3.5, 3.5], but
            there are some exceptional systematic outliers that are very differently distributed for large models.
            These outliers are often in the interval [-60, -6] or [6, 60]. Int8 quantization works well for values of
            magnitude ~5, but beyond that, there is a significant performance penalty. A good default threshold is 6,
            but a lower threshold might be needed for more unstable models (small models, fine-tuning).
        llm_int8_skip_modules (`list[str]`, *optional*):
            An explicit list of the modules that we do not want to convert in 8-bit. This is useful for models such as
            Jukebox that has several heads in different places and not necessarily at the last position. For example
            for `CausalLM` models, the last `lm_head` is kept in its original `dtype`.
        llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used for advanced use cases and users that are aware of this feature. If you want to split
            your model in different parts and run some parts in int8 on GPU and some parts in fp32 on CPU, you can use
            this flag. This is useful for offloading large models such as `google/flan-t5-xxl`. Note that the int8
            operations will not be run on CPU.
        llm_int8_has_fp16_weight (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag runs LLM.int8() with 16-bit main weights. This is useful for fine-tuning as the weights do not
            have to be converted back and forth for the backward pass.
        bnb_4bit_compute_dtype (`torch.dtype` or str, *optional*, defaults to `torch.float32`):
            This sets the computational type which might be different than the input type. For example, inputs might be
            fp32, but computation can be set to bf16 for speedups.
        bnb_4bit_quant_type (`str`,  *optional*, defaults to `"fp4"`):
            This sets the quantization data type in the bnb.nn.Linear4Bit layers. Options are FP4 and NF4 data types
            which are specified by `fp4` or `nf4`.
        bnb_4bit_use_double_quant (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            This flag is used for nested quantization where the quantization constants from the first quantization are
            quantized again.
        bnb_4bit_quant_storage (`torch.dtype` or str, *optional*, defaults to `torch.uint8`):
            This sets the storage type to pack the quanitzed 4-bit prarams.

            Additional parameters from which to initialize the configuration object.

        tokenizer (`str` or `PreTrainedTokenizerBase`, *optional*):
            The tokenizer used to process the dataset. You can pass either:
                - A custom tokenizer object.
                - A string, the *model id* of a predefined tokenizer hosted inside a model repo on huggingface.co.

        group_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 128):
            The group size to use for quantization. Recommended value is 128 and -1 uses per-column quantization.
        damp_percent (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The percent of the average Hessian diagonal to use for dampening. Recommended value is 0.1.
        desc_act (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to quantize columns in order of decreasing activation size. Setting it to False can significantly
            speed up inference but the perplexity may become slightly worse. Also known as act-order.
        sym (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to use symmetric quantization.
        true_sequential (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to perform sequential quantization even within a single Transformer block. Instead of quantizing
            the entire block at once, we perform layer-wise quantization. As a result, each layer undergoes
            quantization using inputs that have passed through the previously quantized layers.
        checkpoint_format (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"gptq"`):
            GPTQ weight format. `gptq`(v1) is supported by both gptqmodel and auto-gptq. `gptq_v2` is gptqmodel only.
        meta (`dict[str, any]`, *optional*):
            Properties, such as tooling:version, that do not directly contributes to quantization or quant inference are stored in meta.
            i.e. `meta.quantizer`: ["optimum:_version_", "gptqmodel:_version_"]
        backend (`str`, *optional*):
            Controls which gptq kernel to be used. Valid values for gptqmodel are `auto`, `auto_trainable` and more. For auto-gptq, only
            valid value is None and `auto_trainable`. Ref gptqmodel backends: https://github.com/ModelCloud/GPTQModel/blob/main/gptqmodel/utils/backend.py
        use_cuda_fp16 (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to use optimized cuda kernel for fp16 model. Need to have model in fp16. Auto-gptq only.
        model_seqlen (`int`, *optional*):
            The maximum sequence length that the model can take.
        block_name_to_quantize (`str`, *optional*):
            The transformers block name to quantize. If None, we will infer the block name using common patterns (e.g. model.layers)
        module_name_preceding_first_block (`list[str]`, *optional*):
            The layers that are preceding the first Transformer block.
        batch_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            The batch size used when processing the dataset
        pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*):
            The pad token id. Needed to prepare the dataset when `batch_size` > 1.
        use_exllama (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to use exllama backend. Defaults to `True` if unset. Only works with `bits` = 4.
        max_input_length (`int`, *optional*):
            The maximum input length. This is needed to initialize a buffer that depends on the maximum expected input
            length. It is specific to the exllama backend with act-order.
        exllama_config (`dict[str, Any]`, *optional*):
            The exllama config. You can specify the version of the exllama kernel through the `version` key. Defaults
            to `{"version": 1}` if unset.
        cache_block_outputs (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to cache block outputs to reuse as inputs for the succeeding block.
        modules_in_block_to_quantize (`list[list[str]]`, *optional*):
            List of list of module names to quantize in the specified block. This argument is useful to exclude certain linear modules from being quantized.
            The block to quantize can be specified by setting `block_name_to_quantize`. We will quantize each list sequentially. If not set, we will quantize all linear layers.
            Example: `modules_in_block_to_quantize =[["self_attn.k_proj", "self_attn.v_proj", "self_attn.q_proj"], ["self_attn.o_proj"]]`.
            In this example, we will first quantize the q,k,v layers simultaneously since they are independent.
            Then, we will quantize `self_attn.o_proj` layer with the q,k,v layers quantized. This way, we will get
            better results since it reflects the real input `self_attn.o_proj` will get when the model is quantized.

            The number of bits to quantize to.
        group_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 128):
            The group size to use for quantization. Recommended value is 128 and -1 uses per-column quantization.

        version (`AWQLinearVersion`, *optional*, defaults to `AWQLinearVersion.GEMM`):
